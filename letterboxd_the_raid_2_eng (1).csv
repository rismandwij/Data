"Things I've learned from The Raid 2:  - Indonesian people snap like twigs.  - I didn't like the first film because of its lack of plot and its repetitive nature.

First close all the hardware stores and second bring guns. They'd have no weapons and the guns they have…",3,"english"

"This movie was great but I still liked the first one a bit more. This sequel had more story, while still having all the cool action scenes.

"I have been incredibly busy this week and have neglected Letterboxd as a result, though somehow, I carved out time to rewatch this grand exercise in action indulgence. The Raid is a lean, mean, bone-snapping machine, notable not just for its well-choreographed action but also for its efficiency.

"The Raid 2: Berandal is a bold sequel that instead of being just a rehash of the first film, it goes one step further by having well developed characters and a very gripping story.

"2011's The Raid was lean, mean, lightning-paced, and carried absolutely zero baggage, it was a supercharged combination of visual flair and insane ultraviolence.

"Remember when I stated that The Raid is action cinema at its best? The Raid 2 IS not only action cinema at its best, but it's still, IMO, the greatest action movie ever made. What an epic two and a half hour Indonesian gangster movie!  Beautiful choreography, frantic, yet coherent camerawork with fluid, precise editing, gorgeous cinematography that takes advantage of the grander scale of the story and various locations, and with some of the most wince-inducing violence onscreen, what an enthralling experience.

I love the small-scale approach of the first film, but the expanded scope and world of the sequel make it feel fresh and less of a rehash. Everything feels bigger.

"Despite The Raid 2 carrying even better set-pieces than its predecessor, I used to lean more towards THE RAID’s self-contained, more streamlined narrative. However, after revisiting this, I now prefer the grander scope, epic-like narrative ambitions, and stronger character work of the sequel.

Generally a weak story is excusable when your characters are called baseball bat man and hammer girl but when the film clocks in at 150 minutes and larger gaps exist in between the beatings, boredom calls for a stronger (or at least more compelling) story.  But what kind of dork goes to an asian martial arts movie for the story. Fuck me right?",7,"english"
"Don't see this if you have a heart condition. And even then, it might be worth the risk.  I jest of course, but in reality, Gareth Evans has crafted some of the most pulse-pounding, violent, brutal, and batshit insane action sequences ever. The last hour or so of this film is just bonkers: balls-to-the-wall violence that's incredibly entertaining. Probably the closest a film will ever get to directly injecting you with adrenaline.  This proves Evans to be an excellent filmmaker.…",7,"english"
"The Raid 2: Raid Harder  Well, you can't say Gareth Evans didn't try for a story this time around. Almost half of this sequel's 150(!) minute runtime is not action scenes. Sure, the story is about as generic an undercover cop/triad story as you'll find, the kind of thing Ringo Lam would have dismissed 30 years ago as cliched, then spiced up with Simon Yam going full-ham in an alligator suit or something. That's really the only thing Evans is…",7,"english"
"On the evidence of The Raid 2, we need to seriously start taking note of Gareth Evans as a major directorial talent of the future. After wowing people out of nowhere not just with The Raid, but equally many with his contribution to horror anthology VHS 2 ('Safe Haven' - check it out immediately), Evans delivers what can arguably rank as his zenith so far in a career where he's barely put a foot wrong yet. The fact he wrote,…",9,"english"

"There are people making worse films (at least he gets great fight choreography), but if I could stop anyone from making movies, I think it would be Gareth Evans and his infantile understanding of drama, slipshod directorial ability, and almost comical post-Nolan extremity.

Now, I’d say The Raid 2 is not really a “bad movie.” However, while some of it’s individual sequences, like many of the fight scenes, far surpass those in the first Raid, the sum of its parts doesn’t add up to being even a fraction as good as that film.   What’s so great about the first Raid isn’t just that…",6,"english"

If you have seen the first film and not yet seen this film I should warn you the film is much longer (like 50 minutes longer) and I would say it is roughly 15 more minutes of fighting with 35 more minutes of dialogue.

The Raid 2 takes everything that was great about The Raid, cranks it up the nth degree, and doesn't let up for a moment as it steamrolls the viewer with a non-stop barrage of AMAZING fight sequences while simultaneously crafting an excellent story full of intriguing new characters. Hell, people shouldn't even bother making action films after this one because they are sure to seem paltry by comparison. The action genre is done and Gareth Evans is the winner.",9,"english"

"This one fights dirty.  Merrily tests your threshold for hardcore action violence as it relentlessly thrusts forward. I preferred its sprawling, limitless set-pieces to the brilliant original. This is next level action entertainment that is so artfully edited and photographed that I can't imagine where this filmmaker will take us next, but I'm thrilled beyond measure and will happily follow him anywhere. Hard to pick a favorite sequence, but I will say the car chase. That's action movie heaven and I need to watch that bit again...now.",9,"english"
"When I looked at the first installment of what's become known as The Raid duology, I made mention of an original project that Gareth Evans had to put on the back-burner until he made a film that could convince producers to have more faith in an up-and-comer like him. Titled Berandal (which translates to either thug, hooligan, or rascal, yeah I can see why sticking with the Indonesian word makes it seem cooler), the original script was a standalone action…",8,"english"
"Hadn't watched this in a few years and after Revenge whet my appetite for that new school ultra-violence I figured it was time for another ride.  The Raid 2 expands on Gareth Evan's hyper-harsh action flick The Raid: Redemption in a variety of ways: longer running time, a more complex plot, loftier dynamics, and more imaginative fight scenes. While I still love the first film's unrelenting journey upwards through the apartment complex from hell, I'm a sucker for an operatic…",9,"english"
"Hyper stylized and hyper violent, just the way I like my action films. The first one for me now stands as a corner stone of modern action films for which I will most likely hold any and all action films too from now on. It's fantastic set, impressive editing and superb cinematography all show an immense talent from Gareth Evans and his team. Unfortunately, The Raid 2 doesn't reach the 30th floor like it's predecessor but it is still a…",7,"english"
"The Raid 2: Berandal is cinema at its most stylishly ultra-violent. The screen gets a crimson mask in this brutal, ruthless, unrelenting, unapologetic, briskly paced, inexhaustible, imaginatively violent, bloodstained martial arts motion picture that is jam-packed with highly skilled hand-to-hand combat, sadistic slaughter, exaggerated butchery, unbridled savagery and alarmingly unique usage of everyday tools and sports equipment, in the midst of a frank yet dreadfully complex plotline. Martial arts, action has never been so trendily ferocious. Parallel to its predecessor,…",8,"english"

"In The Raid, the action was incredible while the story was slight and perhaps too simple. It needed more meat on its bones.  With The Raid 2, the action is again unbelievably well staged and often jaw dropping to watch, but like a flipped coin to the first movie - there's too much story!. There's so much meat here it's overweight. 2 hours and 30 minutes is ridiculous. Ridiculous.  So with The Raid 3, director Gareth Evans i'm hoping, will get the balance right. If he does, it could be the perfect action film.  Fingers are crossed.",4,"english"

"Astoundingly choreographed, gleefully graphic, yet leaden with the thinnest of characters, excessive plotting, and bloated pace (the opening 45 minutes are basically a prologue to the actual story!). I adore what Evans does with the action and tone, the insanely complex set-pieces he designs and the merciless choreography the performers unleash.

"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Despite the many breathtaking sequences (and I mean many), this falls short of the first film for me, but rather than that being down to actual flaws, I think it's more to do with personal taste.

It's funny, during the first movie I was wishing for more of a story. During this movie, which provides that story I wanted, all I wanted was everyone to shut up and get back to fighting. I'm never happy I guess. I think it's just because the fight sequences were so good I just wanted more and more of it.

So personally, I’ve come to the conclusion that I like the more contained first film a little more.  Both are still great, though.  However, the kitchen fight scene is probably my favorite scene in either film and almost warrants a 4.5 alone.",8,"english"
"The Raid 2 is a little more drawn out than the first one as far as pacing, but the more detailed story pays off in the end. The action is just as good, if not better. There are some absolutely brutal scenes in this that make other action movies look like a WWE house show. One of my favorite aspects of these two films is the camerawork though. It never feels like you're being cheated by the camera, every subtle movement is there for you to see plainly.  I seriously regret not watching these films sooner.",9,"english"

From fighting off a swarm of prisoners to choking people with seatbelts, The Raid 2 delivers us two hours of bloodbath, and leave us thirsting for more. Violence had never been this fun!

This loss of my equilibrium could be attributed to many factors; an untied shoelace, sticky floor surface, a tumour between the brain and the ear.

The first Raid film was a pretty much entertaining action flick full of crushed skulls and shortened limbs, it didn't have any plot but instead it had lots of bad-ass villains and the choreography of action scenes was creative and thrilling enough to drag the viewer along for almost 100 minutes. After the critical and commercial success of the…",5,"english"

The first part had nothing much in terms of a plot, while the second opts for a story driven action narrative.

The kitchen fight between Rama and The Assassin is one of the greatest fight scenes I’ve ever seen. Great plot. Solid performances. Brilliant direction from Evans.

"What I’ve come to really appreciate in action movies, as much as clarity and choreography, is a sense of purposeful momentum. Where the story and action are interwoven rather than the spectacle being gratuitous. Fury Road, Terminator, The Matrix, Die Hard, John Wick, The Raid all excel in that department.

"Director Gareth Evan's action extravaganza The Raid worked beautifully because he didn't try to make it something it wasn't, simply allowing it to be a hardcore, balls-to-the-wall action film.

CGI blood...hate it, always have and always will. Do you know how sharp those hammer claws would have to be to pull off those moves?...but I don't care, it's hammers...on a train!  They proved they could make an insanely bad-ass action/martial arts…",10,"english"
"An insane action film with a bunch of pointless plotting in between.  Our hero from the first installment of The Raid is sent undercover, including a surprise 2 year stint in prison, so that he can infiltrate and attempt to bring down the gangs and corrupt cops in the city. Too bad the plotting is contrived and expansive to the point of being non-sensical. Not that this film needs it. You go to a Raid film for the action and…",7,"english"
"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Probably one of the most violent films I've had the pleasure to see at the cinema, where a few of the scenes would not look out of place in a horror/slasher movie. The combination of camera work and choreography hits peaks of the sublime, making the mind boggle at how it was done but not allowing you to wonder too long, as there is usually another awesome feat seconds later. This is where Gareth Evans and company triumph, with a…",8,"english"
"I doff the proverbial cap to Gareth Evans. He had already achieved with The Raid what was one of the most intensely violent action movies ever made. How could he possibly top it? Well, The Raid 2 tops it with such ease in terms of it's action I left the cinema and immediately called the emergency service, I was brutalised by it. It's like having all the bones in your body broken, repaired then broken again all the while begging…",10,"english"
"The Raid 2: Berandal carries on from where the first film left off with Iko Uwais still a bad-ass cop, only this time his mission has him seeking out corruption. Won't go too far into the story as there's not a lot to it and if I say too much, it might ruin it. Suffice to say, the story is once again pretty decent, enough to support the rest of the film, but the weakest element overall.  So, you remember…",8,"english"
"Initial thoughts as leaving 'The Raid 2':  Holy shit. Oh my god...'The Raid 2'...I just...Words cannot describe...So. Fucking. AWESOME!  Now that I've had time to appropriately calm down from it:  'The Raid 2' is probably the single greatest action film I've ever seen. That's not even hyperbole. The film is just insane. If the first film was 'The Terminator', this is 'Terminator 2'. Tense, brutal, saturated in story, beautifully shot, incredibly edited, great characters, and the action...oh dear lord, the…",10,"english"
"Yesterday I went to the cinema in Jakarta to watch The Raid 2. Two persons in front me at the ticketing office bought 40 tickets for this film. That gives an idea how popular The Raid is Indonesia. And I think they are right in being so supportive of a film that finally puts Indonesia on the cinematic map of the world.  The Raid 2 is an improvement of the original in every way imaginable I think. The story is…",8,"english"
"A two and a half hour long action boner. Like a boner, it's a tad overlong and a little, erm, indulgent. But some boners are just too huge, meaty, and filled with substantial substances to ignore, and The Raid 2 is one such boner.  Gareth Evans shoots and edits the shit out of this film, while Iko Uwais sizzles the screen with incredible intensity and beautifully handled martial arts prowess. The choreography is a thing to behold; so impossibly complex…",9,"english"
"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Before I grew into the wide-ranging cinephile I am now, I was something of an action-movie buff. I watched Die Hard at the cusp of my teenage years and was floored enough by it to seek out not only its sequels, but many of the knock-offs that came in the wake of its financial success. One of the knock-offs for which I retain a soft spot is Renny Harlin's Cliffhanger (1993), or ""Die Hard on a mountain."" Sure, I could…",7,"english"
"""Watch over me.""  The Raid 2 outdoes its predecessor in every conceivable way. It's not just an action film, it's an epic tale of crime, violence, corruption, and betrayal.  The action sequences here are incredible. I dare say they're better than what we see in the John Wick franchise; they might not be as bold, sure, but the quality is undeniably higher. They found a way to turn every single death into a self-contained event, it does not feel like…",8,"english"

"Needs more baseball bat guy…  The first film of these hyper violent action movies is a master class in how to direct a fight scene: precise choreography combined with deliberate camera work— no hamfisted Frankensteins of a bunch of different shaky cam angles incoherently edited together. It was a simple premise and it worked well. Evans uses the first as a mere prologue and made an overlong crime epic out of it.  I can see the draw to expand upon…",6,"english"
"“No, I’m done.” Wow. This movie just really had me sit here process the insanity of this film. The first one was a huge surprise as it had some of the best fight choreography ever put to film with a decent enough story.

It has a more complex story(which is too convoluted for its own good) and the action is shockingly even better in…",7,"english"

"Warning: Mild spoilers and major hyperbole.  Look, I'll be the first to admit the The Raid: Redemption wasn't exactly a masterpiece. For the most part it was a meat tenderizer commercial crossed with Das Boot. However, it still had that gonzo ""take no prisoners"" vibe, some brutally well executed set-pieces and one or two moments of genuine suspense (""Machate Meets Secret Wall Hideout"" anyone?).  Ironically, the more Gareth Evans' story opens up in the sequel, the more it feels hemmed…",5,"english"
"Spectacular sequel to one of the greatest martial-arts movies of all time. You could shower The Raid 2 in empty hyperboles and flattering adjectives without coming close to the intensity that the fight scenes delivers and the living badassery that Iko Uwais represents.  Unlike it's predecessor, there's a plot here. Which is overly long and kinda chews over too much. But it's cool though, because the acting is great. Mad dog is given a human side to his insanity. Hammer…",7,"english"
"I think every filmmaker should now just pack up and go home, there's no point carrying on anymore. As someone so eloquently said just after the Sundance screening (I can't remember who so please forgive the lack of credit): Gareth Evans has just won movies.  This film is, in my opinion, perfect. The first Raid film was my favourite of 2012, and so the sequel had a lot to live up to. Bigger and grander in every way, it delivers…",10,"english"
"Everyone can now readjust their top ten fight and car chase sequences to accommodate those in The Raid 2.  The muddy prison, the highway speed chase, the subway with Hammer Girl and the climactic restaurant scene. They are actually aimed to not replicate Evans' predecessor.

"The sequel to 2012's (US release) The Raid, which is one of the greatest action films ever made, Gareth Evans released The Raid 2 based on a script that he actually wrote before The Raid 1.

"There's something to be said for both The Raid: Redemption and The Raid: Berandal... Both are incredible martial arts films with different approaches to storytelling. Both have their faults and their glory and their respective effectiveness, but I'm not going to say one's better than the other. It's an excellent action series.",8,"english"
"It's rare that a sequel improves on the original. This is one of those cases. The Raid 2 stepped up the game on everything The Raid: Redemption had to offer. The action, the story, the characters, the suspense, everything.  The action. THE ACTION in this movie was amazing. the fight scenes, the car chases, the shoot outs, it just kept your eyes on the screen at all times. The story was much more opened out this time, with characters that light up the screen and have purpose for being there.  The Raid: Redemption was good. The Raid 2: Berandal was great.",9,"english"
"Saw this second time on the big screen in less then three months. Its still awesome and kick ass movie...although I have to say that on second watch story parts of the movie where a bit slower then first time I watch the movie.

"45/100  Las Vegas Weekly review, to which I apparently forgot to link at the time. Classic careful-what-you-wish-for scenario: I bailed on the original at TIFF because its nonstop unmodulated action bored me (also because it was a midnight screening and I was tired), but that was nothing compared to the tedium of this film's byzantine plot. Surely there's a happy medium to be found.",5,"english"
"I really liked The Raid, and the best thing about it was that they'd skipped the bullshit, and just filled it with a lot of high quality action. In The Raid 2 they've kept the well coreographed action, but in between you have a lot of bullshit I didn't really care that much about. I'm seldom impressed by crime syndicate/gangster stories, and when it's this overcomplicated (for this kind of a movie) and extremely illogical as in The Raid 2,…",6,"english"

"Corruption, loyalty, and the facade of order. As Rama delves deeper into the criminal underworld, he discovers that corruption is rampant, and loyalty is a rare commodity. Power stains, and that those who wield it are often willing to do whatever it takes to maintain their hold on it. One of the most prominent themes in The Raid saga is the idea of loyalty.

"Hammer Girl and Bat Boy go stupid in this movie. The final 25 minutes is pure lunacy. The car sequence is fucking nuts. The train scene is iconic. I honestly forgot about the prison yard brawl in the mud. Holy fuck, that shit is insane lmao. I love the first as it’s clear cut and just intense action at only an hour forty mins. This is a lot longer at two and half hours and a much larger story, but the action still is crazy and doesn’t let up.   Quite the double feature of both films to watch with my son lol",10,"english"
"The Raid 2 is the best action movie of all time and anyone who says otherwise is simply insane.

A little Deep Cover with a classic yakuza turf war. Where the…",10,"english"
"Although The Raid 2 has plenty of well-choreographed (and incredibly violent) action sequences, it felt a lot less intense than it's predecessor. Perhaps it was the lack of the claustrophobic and hostile environment of the first film, or the increased focus placed on blood and gore in this one, but I wasn't nearly as engrossed by the fighting this time around.  With that said, there was still a tangible sense of satisfaction with every punch and kick, and the film on the whole was still a good time.",7,"english"
"The Raid 2 picks up where the last film left out. Rama leaves the building doing what he believes is the right thing as an officer of the law. Unfortunate crime and corruption run so deep in the city that going by the books isn't an option.

W🌍RLD MAP 🇮🇩  76/100  I've put this off for a while as I really wasn't sure if this could be as good as the first but if anything it improves on the original by switching things up just enough.

The choreography is…",10,"english"
"The Raid 2 may just be the perfect sequel. It takes everything that made the first great, adds to it, then fully expands on everything that the first neglected such as narrative, characters, drama, and settings creating a more complete film that can play to a bit wider audience.

This film is basically a steroided up version…",9,"english"
"Here on Letterboxd I once described The Raid 2 as being inferior to the original film and slightly disappointing in comparison, if not still very good. It is primarily for this reason that I’d like to formally declare that I will hearby stop smoking crack. The Raid 2 is a sprawling, slick, tense and occasionally surprisingly emotional martial arts crime epic that plays like the first film spliced with The Departed. Excellent from start to finish, makes me sad that The Raid 3 is never going to happen.",10,"english"
"I totally blanked on reviewing this when I saw it. The movie is nearly as good as the original, which is saying A LOT. It is exceptionally brutal in the way I've only really seen Gareth Evans get with his fighting movies.  What was interesting about this movie is how he manages to capture the same vibe of the first film while totally flipping the focus of the action. Where the first is claustrophobic and contained, this film is expansive.…",8,"english"
"As brutal and delicious as a steak resting in its own blood.  All the viscera and screaming and gleeful dismemberment hides a core of regret. Relationships failed, ties broken, lives abandoned.  The complexity of human interaction is boiled down until all that's left is a skeleton of desperation.",10,"english"
"More action, more story, more characters and more budget. Everything's more in the second one. And it doesn't lose the charm.  Even though the story is extreme thin, and after the third rewatch you just want to skip forward, and the acting isn't better than in the first movie, this is one of the best action films we got in the last 10-20 years.",9,"english"
"How can I put this subtly? RAID 2 is the greatest action spectacle since John Woo’s THE KILLER. Nothing short of the benchmark to be aspired too in the future for excitement, cinematography and staging this game changer makes most in the genre seem like light sparing at best.

"For the sequel, as opposed to pulling a Die Hard 2 & doing the same thing as the original but in a new location, Gareth Evans pulled a Die Hard 3; taking our lead character & throwing him into a new kind of adventure.

"It's a question of ambition, really. Let me rephrase that. It's a matter of limitation. And the importance of knowing yours.  Gareth Evans' operatic action masterpiece, a gloves-off, gnarly as hell banger that opens the doors from its predecessor into a sprawling gang war that covers the entire city of Jakarta.

"When THE RAID: REDEMPTION came out it kind of blew the minds of action movie lovers, myself included. The sheer brutality and momentum of the film, along with its very basic plot structure made it a revelation in how action films could be advanced.

Director Evans, decided to take a different tack with the film, completely abandoning the streamlined structure of the first…",9,"english"
"After seeing The Raid, I didn't think there was anyway a sequel could live up to the hype. In short, The Raid 2 is astounding and very much lives up to the hype.

The fights are why I'm here singing its praises though as they justify what would otherwise be a good, but overlong film.  This all being said, The…",9,"english"
"Managing to make this bigger and better than its predecessor, writer/director Gareth Huw Evans delivers a truly spectacular sequel with The Raid 2: Berandal, one of the finest and most entertaining action films in years, with pulse-pounding and expertly crafted action sequences, improved-upon plotting and dialogue, solid acting all around, stunning cinematography, and rapid-fire pacing.",10,"english"
"A very enjoyable action/martial arts film. Iko Uwais reprises his role as Rama and is absolutely incredible. One of the top film fighters I have seen. Arifin Putra as Uco is also solid. Enjoyed Julie Estelle as Hammer Girl. The fight scenes and choreography were top notch. A ton of blood and gore. The premise was much different than the first film. A long film coming in at 2 hours and 20 minutes. I would watch this over just for the fight scenes.",10,"english"

Kind of a loose, muddled story - I still don't know who was supposed to be a corrupt cop and who was not - however I'm paying a ticket for the action scenes, not character development.  Biggest complaint is that this film really overstays its welcome. No action movie should be two and…",7,"english"
"I can't really write a review about this movie. It's hands down the best movie of 2014 and easily one of the best actions movies ever made. It's set the bar very high for future action movies.

The saddening reality is this film has not gotten much widespread recognition outside of film festivals. I believe it…",10,"english"

From the opening that made me want to tear my hair out, to the ending that made me want to tear my hair out (in a great way, of course), my eyes were completely glued to the screen. Rama, played wonderfully by Iko Uwais, is pretty freaking awesome, kicking and swiping in his black and white sneakers.…",8,"english"
"Firstly... Thank fuck this is a sequel that treads its own path! Gareth Evans builds upon the corrupt world of police and gangsters from his original and creates an undercover cop movie with touches of Infernal Affairs and Hong Kong gangster flicks of the eighties and nineties.

The meticulous and breathtaking choreography…",10,"english"
"Negatives out of the way first so I can then gush about it. The story is convoluted and clunky in places, it's completely different to the original which is not a bad thing at all.

Arifin Putra who plays Uco is amazing, probably the stand out actor as he has the most emotional…",9,"english"

"I saw a review here that compared The Raid and The Raid 2 to the same kind of evolution undergone between Alien and Aliens, (although I’d say Terminator and T2 is the more fitting comparison since both Raids are directed by Evans).

"The budget it bigger, the action is bigger, but unfortunately this doesn't quite reach the high highs of the first one. There was beauty in the simplicity of the first film; a tight, 100-minute, bone-crushing, machete-chopping, kick-fueled thrill ride.

The formula of a good sequel is really strong in this one, more action, more characters and the stakes are higher than ever.

"The Raid 2 is an action masterpiece. The fight sequences have rarely been surpassed. Even by the likes of the John Wick movies. However, of there’s one flaw it is that it’s a smidgen too long. The Prakoso storyline feels so random and unnecessary (though the nightclub fight is a banger) for example. This doesn’t take much away from the movie though. It’s still an absolute joy. An interesting, sprawling movie punctuated by wonderful martial arts beats.  This is how action movies should be made.",9,"english"
"I love how the fighting style in both of these movies incorporates ""grab whatever's around you and throw it at the other guy."" It is enjoyably dirty yet strategic, and who doesn't want to see Iko Uwais stab a man with a bottle of soy sauce?  Anyways, it is rare to see a movie with this much ambition, and even more rare to see one that pulls off almost all of it! There is plenty of convolution and a bit…",9,"english"

"The Raid 2 has to have the most brutal explosive and thrilling violence I've seen in a film, completely fucked up and vicious.  Gareth Evans completely out does himself here in this sequel, action on a much larger scale, drama levels even higher, style and creativity in how its shot and laid out is through the roof.

The original was brilliant in its simplicity and its focus on a single location and goal. The second instalment is more complex.

What it does share with its predecessor is impeccably choreographed action…",8,"english"

Gareth Evans is a like a savant in his understanding of how to shoot and edit fight scenes for maximum visceral impact. Iko Uwais has quickly entered into my shortlist of favorite actors. There's something so refreshing about the style and execution of these films in comparison to the regular, tired horseshit that Hollywood passes for action nowadays. THIS is what the bar should be, what it needs to be.",10,"english"

I didn't think The Raid could be surpassed but I am happy to declare it has and then some. My only complaint is that the bar has been raised so high I don't see how the trilogy capper can come close. But considering it will have the same talent behind it I wait to be proven wrong. Cannot wait to see this again.",10,"english"

If you like the first Raid then it almost certain you like the follow up, which you'd think be a no brainer, but strangely enough the two films are actually very much unlike one another.

Its predecessor, The Raid: Redemption, was a surprising and refreshing addition to the action film genre. It is one of the best action movies I’ve ever had the pleasure of seeing. Not surprisingly, Gareth Evans’ The Raid 2 is a great sequel that is similar in its action and fight sequences with a more developed story, bigger…",10,"english"
"So the first one is an all out action flick, this one is a gangster flick, can the next please be an investigative thriller",9,"english"
"The first ""Raid"" film had a certain anonymity to it. The distance from the characters kept the audience from truly having a notion as to who would come out standing. For the most part, ""The Raid 2"" does away with that. Instead what we have is an attempt at a character driven film with some of the best action presented in the last decade put inside a muddled plot which focuses too much on its villains.  Imagine if ""The Godfather""…",8,"english"
"One of the most exhilarating, brutally shocking, entertaining, and expertly crafted action movies I've seen in quite some time. The first Raid film was easily one of the most intense and nail biting action films I'd ever seen with some of the most impressively choregography fight scenes, and this one somehow just surpasses it in basically every way. Seriously, I can't possibly count the amount of times I was grinning like an idiot or how many times I grasp. It…",9,"english"
"This is one hell of an ambitious movie. I really appreciate that the movie didn't just rehash the premise of the first one. Instead, it tried to go with a big plot and a long running time. I say tried because the story the movie went with, an undercover cop in a corrupt merciless world, is hardly something mind-blowingly original. The dialogue didn't always work, nor did most of the characters. A lot of the time the plot just felt…",9,"english"
"It's pretty spiffy how they managed to both ratchet up the gratuitous violence beyond that of the first one and make it more boring at the same time.",5,"english"
"The first THE RAID was, by design, virtually without story or characters, but at least it was lean. THE RAID 2: RAIDIER, however, seems to be overcompensating with an unnecessarily complicated (but fairly standard) Yakuza/gang-war/corrupt cops plot, and an absurd two and a half hour running time. And while there are some interesting lightly sketched characters this time (Homeless Assassin and Deaf Hammer Girl both deserve their own movies), we spend too much of our time with Whiny Daddy's Boy…",6,"english"
"It has the opposite positives and negatives from the first one, but since the positives are pretty goddamn high and the negatives are pushed to the film's first half, that makes me like it better than Redemption. This lacks the first one's sheer desperation of being trapped and having to fight tooth-and-nail to stay alive, and the mafia plot is only serviceable with a set-up that is just too long for some pretty derivative conflicts.  On the other hand, opening…",8,"english"
"The Raid 2 ups the ante from the original in terms of scale and story, and even in some of the action sequences. We get more unique henchmen, we get operatic gangland struggles with a vast swath of unique characters, and we get multiple hardcore, violent, and brutal action sequences that satisfy as much as the original- which is a huge order.  Things pick up right where the original leaves off, or at least, it partly does. Amongst multiple time…",8,"english"
"Whoa. I liked the first one ok, but THE RAID 2 is straight-up BANANAS!  This is simply 2 1/2 hours of high-kicking, upper-cutting, hammer-gouging, machete-slicing, bat-smashing, wall-crushing, blade-slashing, bone-crunching insanity, and I mean that in the best way possible.  Whereas THE RAID tended to be a bit monotonous and I felt it overstayed its welcome a bit even at just 101 minutes, I was really worried that the sequel (nearly a full hour longer!) would be similarly numbing. I'm happy…",9,"english"
"Predictably, I absolutely loved this film. Its hard for me to not be hyperbolic about it.  It is long and the dourness might make it a tough watch for some, but it showed me things I've never seen on screen before and the action has got to be some of the best ever captured.",10,"english"
"There's something fitting about how The Raid 2 opens with a brief monologue about the perils of ambition, and learning the hard way of one's own limitations. Perhaps this is director Gareth Evans' airing his own insecurities about expanding on his hit action film The Raid, a masterpiece of brutal, non-stop martial-arts action with a very simple story and brief length, and crafting the follow-up into a sprawling, two-and-a-half hour crime saga. The Raid has achieved enough word-of-mouth success to…",10,"english"
"Year in Review: 2014  Have you ever seen a sequel so good, so pitch perfect that you feel the urge to go back and lower your score of the first film? No? Go see The Raid 2. The divide in quality between the films is so tremendous that they do not deserve to be rated so closely together.  Most notable about The Raid 2 is the plot. Not only is there actually a full story, but the story completely dominates…",10,"english"

Our main hero leaves one of the largest body counts and has the skills necessary to demolish most of our favorite action stars.  The Raid 2 is a…",9,"english"
"""Bring back the ball.""  Well, that was disappointing. Not only was this not the ""best action film ever"" like so many had claimed, but it wasn't as good as the first one.

Sadly, adding that element into this sequel not only slowed the pace down significantly, but it didn't add anything new to the genre as well. Overall, I was…",6,"english"
"I.... I think I liked The Raid better.... I'm gonna have to watch this again to make sure. That car chase scene tho Im_so_wet.jpg",8,"english"
"Mind blowing action that more than equals the amazing first instalment. Full of action sequences that puts anything Hollywood does to shame, notably the kitchen fight sequence, we as viewers are also treated to a clever plot that makes sure that the story is not lost behind all the incredible action.  I really just hope and pray that the American remake of the first part, and undoubted remake of this film, don't butcher them. I personally would rather they left it alone, but saying that Hollywood would probably not be able to make anything so original, breathtaking and eye watering themselves.",10,"english"
"I was hyped out of my mind for this movie to the point that I was worried I wouldn't be able to set aside my exceedingly high expectations. Not a problem in the slightest. I was utterly floored by the skill and artistry from everyone involved. This is the martial arts movie. Everything else will now pale in comparison, even The Raid.  The Raid 2 isn't simply a magnificent, audacious, stunning, masterful, just plain fucking awesome martial arts/action film, it's a magnificent, audacious, stunning, masterful, just plain fucking awesome film, period!",10,"english"
"I don’t care that it’s two-and-a-half hours. I don’t care that it’s spectacularly, unapologetically, borderline-insanely violent. I don’t care that it’s over-plotted to a degree that might require a few helpful diagrams. I understand how any and all of those things might be a deal-breaker for any given viewer. But Gareth Evans simply choreographs action as well as any other filmmaker currently alive on the planet, and it’s impossible not to recognize when you’re in the hands of an absolute…",8,"english"
"fuck, the choreography is amazing way more brutal and violent than the first with better character development it's just the run time that the first did better, they just added in 50 minutes of conversation which was so slowly paced and something about the action from start to finish in The Raid was just thrilling  I don't think it would be fair of me to put it down ½ a star because of that and if you take that away, this movie is fantastic",8,"english"
"Fucking perfect from start to end. Not a single boring moment",10,"english"
"I love it when sequels don't contain the thing their title references. I'm perfectly fine that The Raid 2 doesn't contain a titular Raid though. i fucking love anime",8,"english"
"Now this is how you make a sequel. This improved on the first one in virtually every single way, and the first one was really freaking good on its own. So, watch them both on a lazy Saturday night if you got the chance.",10,"english"
"A glorious opera of dense crime drama and epic action thrills. Evans takes everything that is beloved about the Japanese Yakuza films and merges it with everything that was awesome about The Raid. A lot of people will go into this wanting the first film again, but the action is stripped back to only when it is a necessary and the film is a crime drama first and foremost.  The crime drama is hard to engage with in the best…",9,"english"

"Providing action just as brilliant and breathtaking as the original, The Raid 2 takes a slightly different route to The Raid, with a noticeably stronger plot. As opposed to the relatively simple storyline of the first film, the layered story works well for the most part, but the highlight of the film is still the thrilling action sequences.

"I'd only seen this once before, back in 2014, so it was due a rewatch - especially as I rewatched The Raid a couple of days ago.  Writer/Director/Editor Gareth Evans had to make a decision for his sequel - restrict the action to one location again or branch out. He chose to expand the scope of the film in terms of locations, characters and plot, as well as adding 50 minutes to the runtime.  Part of me thinks another lean…",8,"english"
"This shit slaps. Iko Uwais swaps a survival horror, gang infested sky rise for a gritty crime thriller with brutal bouts of graphic violence spread across muddy prison yards, nightclubs, subway cars, and industrial kitchens. Maybe not as tense as the first one but The Raid 2 still delivers on violent bloody action, be it with tiny curved blades, baseball bats, dual hammers, or some ol’ fashion foot n’ fist Fu. A sprawling gangster epic with fight scenes of the highest order is always a win.",8,"english"
"Boasts the same fantastic choreography of the original and features an impressive form of shaky cam that still allows the viewer to see everything going on. I would have still preferred a more stable view, but when it's done this well I can't complain, and I suppose with how fast everyone moves in this it is the best way to capture it all.  In short, The Raid 2 is just as good of an action film as the first one.…",7,"english"
"A masterpiece of action cinema. 150 minutes of ass whooping, bone snapping, and blood pouring. A step up from the first (that I love) in every way. The kitchen scene may be the best action scene of all time. I love you Gareth Evans.",10,"english"
"It's hard to comment on what happened, mostly because I started day dreaming like at the beginning of the movie and only really caught the last 30 minutes. But those were some good 30 minutes. So I'll have to finish it. No matter what though I love that ending.",8,"english"
"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  “No, I’m done.”  All I can say is that if you loved the craziness of the first Raid, then this sequel is 100% worth watching because it is even more crazy. As great as the action in the first movie was, the action here was probably even better. The last 45 or so minutes in particular had some of the best action scenes I’ve ever seen. The car chase, the hallway fight, and the kitchen fight were all just incredible…",8,"english"
"The beauty of the first The Raid was its simplicity, but the camerawork and brutality still shine in this sequel.",7,"english"
"It had been a very long time since I'd seen The Raid and I forgot a lot of it unfortunately, but watching this makes me want to immediately revisit it. There's so much to love here. Each set piece is a carefully orchestrated and memorable event, and our main characters here are decent, but it just didn't feel as remarkable and fresh as The Raid. I appreciate that they're trying to expand upon the first film - or maybe accomplish…",8,"english"
"""With all due respect, I don't really like spending my time acting tough in toilets.""  A very worthy sequel to the original. A very ambitious, well shot, well coordinated, large-scale, and exhilarating thrill-ride of a movie. Not exactly better or worse than the original - I did find this one to be more confusing, a bit unfocused at times, and a little too long. Despite some flaws this is a highly entertaining film with a fantastic third act that everyone should watch - 7/10.",7,"english"
"A visceral thrill ride of torn tendons, broken bones, crushed windpipes, shattered limbs and a whole load of thrown chairs, The Raid 2 ups the ante on the first movie's spectacular action and also adds a complex narrative which is simply an excuse for more painstakingly choreographed violence.",10,"english"

"The sequel to 2011’s groundbreaking action hit. The Raid 2 is set a short time after the first film. Rama (Iko Uwais) goes undercover with the criminals of Jakarta and plans to bring down the syndicate and uncover the corruption within his police force.  Taking the premise of the original film and replacing it with an epic scale organised crime thriller, yet still delivering the perfectly visceral action set pieces certainly feels like a natural and logical step forward. Increasing…",9,"english"
"The first film was non-stop action, but even more importantly Rama was locked in a creepy, dingy, rundown apartment building where every single person inside was trying to kill him. That added something horrific and made the film constantly tense. I don’t think anything in The Raid 2 gets anywhere near as tense as the scene in the first where Rama hides in the wall from the dude with the machete.   The fight scenes are still spectacular, but the added…",7,"english"
"The epitome of a great action sequel. Brings a little something different with a lot of the same batshit crazy nonsense that made the first film so damn exhilarating.",8,"english"
"After the nonstop action of the first film, this sees its star out of the claustrophobic building of doom and undercover in prison as part of a mission to dismantle the crime syndicate.  The fight choreography in this one is even more complex and impressive than what the first film was famous for. The story itself is your basic one vs all undercover cop story, but the action is on another level with the beautiful brutality of everything going on. Awe inspiring.",7,"english"
"The action scenes are SO GOOD! I really wish that Hollywood filmmakers would learn from films like The Raid and The Raid 2 because no one wants to watch an action movie with shaky cam and 163 cuts every second. We actually want to be able to see what is happening on screen.",8,"english"
"I am blown away. What an incredible, over-the-top tour de force. I don't think I fully realized what ""good fight choreography"" was until I saw this. What an absurdly good film.  Here is a summation, briefly, of the thoughts I had during this film:  This is a movie full of Fucked Up Guys. I love every single one of them. Some of them have actual pathos. All of them are fucking incredible. All of them make me feel like this…",9,"english"
"The Raid 2 is a direct improvement upon every single facet of its predecessor (and that is high praise given that The Raid Redemption is such a solid film). The cinematography is far more vibrant and includes dazzling long shots. The direction is even more fluid and dynamic which complements the fight choreography to an even higher degree than what I would think is possible. The editing is also even tighter than the first and keeps the tension high. The…",10,"english"
"Gareth Evans philosophy of shooting action like a horror movie pays off again here, much more stylised with a bigger budget to boot, The Raid 2 is a 2 and 1/2 long master class of action. My biggest grievance is the plot, losing the tight, claustrophobic atmosphere of the original, the film tries to do too much and gets bogged down from it. The deleted ‘gang war’ sequence looks and sounds just as incredible as the rest of the film…",8,"english"

End of final kitchen fight: *Realize my mouth is agape* *slow claps""  ----  I still think the original Raid is a tighter, grittier, better movie overall, but some of the fights in this one reach new levels. Bravo to everyone who had to take a bump in this one...",6,"english"
"Gareth Evans, I salute you and everyone you have assembled here. A sequel on an epic scale that completely eschews the original approach in almost every way and takes the fight choreography and the art of Silat to the next level.  This is leaps and bounds ahead of the first film and while its criminal underworld setup may prove challengingly complex at first, I found it to be skillfully introduced by way of careful and deliberate exposition.  There is so…",10,"english"
"Larded up with an overly complex, vaguely novelistic crime plot that isn't nearly as interesting as writer/director Gareth Evans seems to think it is (seriously, can we get this guy to direct someone else's script?), but if I don't care about the specifics of the story, I still love the style in which it's told, especially the jumbled chronology of the long buildup to the first action scene.  And that's just a cherry on top, the real deal is that…",10,"english"
"As an Indonesian I’m in great remorse that it takes me so looong time to finally watched this bloody masterpiece! Intensely gut-wrenching and horrendously brutal!",9,"english"
"With better, more violent fight sequences than part 1, but overall a bit worse, mainly because of the uninteresting story & because 150 minutes is just wayyyy too long for this movie.  And even if the action is very well-choreographed, it does have its flaws in my opinion, because the editing & cinematography in the action sequences are mostly pretty weak. But the action is still really good, the only part of the movie which kept me entertained.  And it's also still better than the upcoming American remake for sure.",5,"english"
"Gareth Evans going from the hollow, repetitive original Raid to making the best crime film of its kind since Heat is quite the glow up.",10,"english"
"A more than worthy sequel. Same formula that worked so well for the first film is utilised again for The Raid 2. Only this time round, the characters and overall story have greater depth to them.",10,"english"
"Man, what a mixed bag for me.  On one hand, damn, the movie's story just didn't do it for me. Considering that it's two and a half hours long, that's a big issue for me.  On the other hand, BECAUSE it's so long, it gives you a lot more action scenes than the first film, and not only are there more of them, but they're even better than the first.  Seriously, these are some of the most white-knuckled action scenes ever put on screen. If you have the time and you like martial arts films, I can't NOT recommend this movie to you.",7,"english"
"This movie made me sign up at a local martial arts gym and learn Krav Maga. Now I can break peoples elbows too.  An absolutely brilliant fight movie. I kid you not when I say the choreography in this movie is truly insane in every way. Its amazing to see what a trained killer can do to the bodies of other people. I didn't know it was possible for movies with fights to be made this well. If you like violence or the mob, you gotta watch this shit asap. Ive seen it at least a dozen times and it never gets old or less cringy.",10,"english"
"Where the first ""Raid"" film delivered a basic, but effective punch with its deliverance of so much non-stop action that it basically becomes the plot. ""The Raid 2"" comes swinging a bat with its deliverance of not only just as much, even better action sequences-- I'm talking so awesome they make your adrenaline pump!--, but a although predictable, gripping crime-story.  But honestly, given how famous both this film and 'Redemption' is nowadays among Cinephiles for their stellar, almost unreal fighting…",8,"english"
"The Raid 2 did it again! Rama's back and this time... he's got less hair!  There's some fantastic use of space, use of slow-motion, the colouring is sublime and there are fantastic aerial shots. The director uses a perfect sense of 'build-up' so that just before every action piece implodes onto the screen you see yourself rising slightly in your seat, taking a deep breath in, clenching your sweaty palms into fists and yelling OOOOH YEIIIIAAAAH BOIIIIIIYYYY IT'S BOUT TO…",8,"english"
"Can a film be a gritty, epic crime drama AND a ridiculously over-the-top action film with cartoonish villains? Judging by The Raid 2... maybe?  This is a weird one.

"It's all just too much. Sure, the choreography is spectacular, the camera work is slick and it feels just as bone crunching as the first film, but, unlike the The Raid, the character goals here are disjointed and lost in a myriad of double crosses, all of which unfold in fight scenes. There are attempts at characterisation but our undercover cop, Rama, disappears from view for significant portions of running time and when he is on screen (and not fighting)…",6,"english"

"A 2.5 hr ass kicking, limb snapping, tendon slicing, jugular ripping extravaganza. Breaking free of the confines of the tight narrative of the first film, The Raid 2 and its super hero, 'Rama' (Iko Uwais) go bigger in every way. The plot is just a staging for the incredible and intense action, and taking Rama into a number of different locations allows for some spectacular sequences the corridors of The Raid: Redemption didn't allow for. Any criticisms about plot or…",8,"english"
"Just as good as the first film. Violent, brutal, and entertaining.",8,"english"
"A little talky - probably could have skipped some of plot development and shaved off a good twenty minutes - but otherwise delivers scene after scene of absolute joy. Beautifully brutal.",9,"english"
"Taken on its own, The Raid 2 is a better-than-average action flick with delusions of crime saga grandeur. As a sequel to one of the best action films of this century, it suffers. Beefing up the dialogue and characterisations feels overly reactionary to the criticisms leveled at the original, which was almost perfect as it stood. So instead of a stripped back action masterpiece, we're left with a Godfather-wannabe, albeit with some incredible action scenes. Too bad the best of those is the brawl in the prison yard - a fight scene never equaled through the rest of the film.",7,"english"
"One of those rare movies where the second movie is better than the first. A bloody, exciting, adrenaline rush filled romp that will leave you feeling drained right along with the films star by the end. Iko Uwais is a force to be reckoned with and I expect bigger and better things from him in the future, after watching this movie I am now a huge fan.",10,"english"

"Finally, I get to see Gareth Evans' much talked about sequel to the 2011 action masterpiece 'The Raid'. This one is bigger, bloodier and even more brutal than the first, but it is also somewhat bloated, with a crime family storyline that I never much cared for. Evans' ambition is admirable, but the film doesn't hold together as well as its predecessor.  This is clearly not a negative review, though. Although my rating does not quite reflect greatness, there are…",8,"english"
"Look, I know its not balls-out 100% action like the first one. Yeah, I know its long. But don't worry. There is enough story to keep this savage 150 minute gem from ever getting boring.

Also, everything is a weapon.",8,"english"
"Easily one of my favorite films this year thus far. One of the best action movies I've ever seen. The Raid: Redemption was a surprise for me, and I really enjoyed it. This one though?

The fights, and action were unlike anything my eyes have witnessed before, and the just the mere talk of a sequel gave me goosebumps!

You don't, and that's the best thing Evans could have done. I'm actually glad that this film doesn't perpetuate the style of the first one and takes the action in a completely different direction.

"No... I'm done.  While not as good as the original, The Raid 2 is still great action movie. Taking what made the first movie amazing (the action) and taking it way bigger in scope, which works for the most part. That being said most of the action scenes that are great, but not flipping amazing like the entire runtime of The Raid. That that being said there are two JAW DROPPING FREAKING SPECTACULAR action scenes in The Raid 2, the prison…",9,"english"
"Pardon me if I come across like a 12-year old fanboy in this review but, let's face it, the stunt men and women whom worked on this martial arts tour de force deserve an oscar all their own. Who the fuck rated this shit with one star?  The Raid 2 starts off just after the first one ends and builds brilliantly upon what the original established. If there was a flaw with the first film, it was its paper-thin story.…",8,"english"
"It's been a few days since I've posted a review, and you can attribute that to the start of college. I've also been churning through episodes of The Leftovers and Masters of Sex, trying to catch up. It also didn't help that Telltale decided to drop the final episode of their brilliant The Walking Dead game. Anyways, I managed to find some time to day to sit down and re-watch one of my favorite films this year, and it only…",10,"english"
"I don't even think it's a case of too high expectations. This wouldn't have worked for me even if people hadn't been praising it to high heaven. The Godfather of action movies? Come on.. The story is so standard it hurts. That doesn't have to be a problem though. I can get on the wagon that says this is all about the action, but let's be realistic here.  Action films are not made for 2,5 hour running times. And please,…",5,"english"
"Wow. That's all I can really say at this point. Wow. THE RAID 2 showed me violence I never dreamt possible. I am now 100 % a desensitized husk of a human and I'm OK with that. The film is of course a non-stop barrage of astonishing fight scenes - bloodier, more ferocious and inventive than the first film's - but it has all that plus a great plot and well-developed characters. This is a game changer in the action genre, folks.",9,"english"
"I went into this expecting The Raid and though I didn't get that, this is still a well-crafted film. The shots and scenes are gorgeous and the fight scenes are intricate. However, for some reason the pace of the film was off. Each fight felt like it was 3 times as long as it actually was and the film felt like it took forever to get through. As a crime film it's pretty decent, but I vastly preferred the lower budget and simplified first film.",7,"english"
"No such thing as a clean war.  (Watched with mum, she loved it unsurprisingly).",10,"english"
"One of the greatest action films I’ve ever seen in my life, just absolutely fucking CRAZY.    Iko Uwais is absolutely unstoppable as Rama as we see him go deep undercover this time around and holy fuck does Gareth Evans direct and edit the fuck outta this movie, it’s genuinely one of the most impressively entertaining films I’ve seen in a while and it manages to go bigger and bolder than the first with an even longer run time of 150 minutes with even better fight sequences than the first which I thought was impossible.    A perfect movie",10,"english"
"THE RAID 2: BERANDAL is a viscous, bloody, and nonstop action!  I didn’t like this story as much as I liked the first one, but that doesn’t stop this from being a great movie. This is filled with the best choreography and fight scenes I’ve ever seen. The last hour of the movie is nonstop action and my eyes were glued to the screen. The kitchen scene specifically was pure cinematic crack. Not to mention, some of the best camerawork…",8,"english"
"The Raid 2 is an upgrade to it’s predecessor in almost every way. The action-choreography somehow got even better, the fights are more intense, and the story is better ten-fold. The first film had a simple story serving the purpose of a fight gauntlet, whilst the second genuinely focused on a story more than that, and the last 40 minutes is flawless action filmmaking. A must watch if you enjoy the genre.",10,"english"
"When I watched The Raid in late 2021, I had high praise for it and wanted to watch its sequel soon after. That ended up not happening - which may be one of the biggest mistakes I’ve made in my entire cinema career.  Now I loved the first movie, and thought it was a masterpiece (my review made moments after viewing make that clear), but I thought it was missing something. There’s no denying the movie is an action spectacle with…",9,"english"
"Fucking incredible movie",10,"english"
"The Raid 2 is a much more personal affair than The Raid, leaning more into gang politics and police corruption, because of this it is at some points a lot slower than it's predecessor.  The action however is insane and a massive step up from the first movie in every way, each fight scene is masterful, some even lasting several minutes, the entire final half an hour consists of video game-esque boss fights back to back and it's just so much fun.  Raid 3 when, Gareth?",9,"english"
"My favourite gesture to the genre here is when a large item is thrown as a quick distraction; completely missing the henchmen but scaring them like ten steps back anyway.",8,"english"
"Only these two movies can make me laugh and feel absolutely horrified at the same time. Basically a perfect action movie. Can't think of anything else I could have asked from it.",10,"english"
"It makes me very happy that the team behind The Raid 2: Berandal went to such great lengths to make all this silat fighting feel oh so very real and still ended up with characters named Hammer Girl (Julie Estelle) and Baseball Bat Man (Very Tri Yulisman). I mean, the fighting is absolutely electric, so they did a great job, but still. And also, an origin story movie for Baseball Bat Man, please and thank you.  I confess to getting…",7,"english"
"This is literally the pinnacle of cinema",10,"english"
"YESSSSSSSSIR  The Raid 2 is fucking incredible. The action choreography is truly unbelievable, there's fight scenes that are minutes long with no cuts and that fucking rules.  Banger from start to finish.",9,"english"
"this man is singlehandedly responsible for jakarta's mortality rate",7,"english"
"I wait patiently for The Raid 3 to be announced.",10,"english"
"I don’t say this lightly, The Raid 2 is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. This film was made for me. Gareth Evans took the groundwork from the first and adds more style and substance.   The action is what has become the standard. Every action movie that I watch now I instantly compare it to the Raid franchise. It’s one of those movies that after every rewatch I have a new favorite sequence, which rarely happens for me.…",10,"english"
"The first time I got to see The Raid 2 was a screening in March 2014, a cinema experience that has stuck with me for two notable reasons. The first was the two guys sat behind me. As soon as the first piece of dialogue began, right at the start of the film, one turned to the other and griped, ""You never said this was going to be in Spanish!"" and left before the opening title card (which is awesome,…",10,"english"
"The sequel to the well-received THE RAID: REDEMPTION, THE RAID 2 is one of the rare sequels that surpasses the original in every department. The story, unlike its predecessor, is grand in size and scope. Instead of being confined to a single location, Iko Uwais' Rama is sent undercover to ferret out corrupt cops who are being paid off by the gangsters who run the city. To do this, he gets sent to prison where he befriends the son of…",9,"english"
"Pure pain  5 movies worth of the good shit crammed into this   I don’t know what else to say about it  If you haven’t seen it yet, make it a blockbuster night bitch",10,"english"
"I think I was too hard on it the first watch, unfairly comparing it to the first. Now I’ve got more appreciation for the set design, cinematography, and story as well as the awesome fight sequences. Gave it another half star.   (On disc)",9,"english"
"This is a ACTION movie! The fight choreography and action is out of this world and the cinematography is surprisingly fantastic. The plot is simple, but more interesting than in the first one. It does stretch itself a bit sometimes, but you forget about it when you see the next fight scene. It’s highly entertaining and one of the best action movies of the last decade.",8,"english"
"The plot of the first could not possibly be simpler: the cops conduct a raid on a 20-storey building full of violent drug dealers. That's it. And it's fucking great.  So for the sequel, you might think....""Okay, you cops who survived, guess what? We have to conduct another raid. But this one is on a FIFTY-storey building! And it's not just drug dealers in there, it's....drug-dealing cannibal zombies!!!""  Ya know. Same story, but MORE. That's what I was expecting. But…",9,"english"
"Maybe this would be my favorite action movie if I didn’t watch it alone in my bed at 7:30 am",6,"english"
"Gareth Evans is supremely talented at making balletic action beautiful to watch but also feel viscerally painful in a way most action directors could never match.  He's not that talented at much ELSE, but that he is very good at.",9,"english"
"On one hand this is one of the best action movies ever made and on one hand it fails to keep me interested in anything that is happening. The first Raid was so good not only because of the action but because it was simple. It was action action and action delivered to you by mastermind Evans and the amazing stuntmen. This didn't by any means lose that action. It was in fact better in many cases. More variety and…",6,"english"
"While The Raid one gets straight to the point and into the action, The Raid 2 tells a much more in depth story about revenge and gang wars. Iko Uwais brings a surprising amount of depth to his character, building upon his morals and ideals, while the film constantly puts him in situations that would go against those very things that make him the person he is.  The plot is really good and kept me interested throughout the entire 2…",8,"english"
"Nowhere near as lean as its predecessor which is gonna bug alot of people, but the inclusion of a solid Departed-esque story and Evan’s uncanny ability to keep one-upping himself on the action makes this god-tier. Evan’s visual storytelling outside the frenetic action (striking colors, Kubrickian slow-zooms, etc) is also very impressive. A bonafide 5-banger.",10,"english"
"Nice fights to watch. The visuals are good and the acting not annoying for the most parts. What I still don't like: people waiting in the background till it's their turn to fight.",8,"english"
"a sequel that surprising lives up to the original movie's intensity",9,"english"
"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  How to tell that Gareth Evans knows the limits of his actors:  - Rama has next to no identity crisis in this two-hour undercover cop picture a la Infernal Affairs because Iko Uwais can barely meet up to the demands of suddenly expanding his role to the outsider of a gang war.  - Prakoso has a grand total of three scenes and within only one of those scenes, gets to have enough backstory and pathos piled on him as a…",9,"english"
"The story feels a little convoluted and there isn't that much character development or established connection between Rama and Uco, but the action is just mind blowing and beautifully brutal, the score is incredible and the camerawork and choreography is impressive as hell.  It feels overly long, but MAN it's worth it for the fight scenes. That's not even to say the plot driven dialogue scenes stink, they're actually great too. I didn't watch it in shitty American dub mode…",9,"english"

The Raid 2 is just as inventive and exhilarating but it's clearly where Welsh director Gareth Evans really wanted to go. With more plot, more fights and, well, those are pretty much everything so, more everything, The Raid 2 builds an even more violent world that just doesn't know when to quit.  Picking up 2…",8,"english"
"The Raid 2 delivers on all of the elements that made the first film great, and strives to be even more ambitious. Normally I am skeptical of any sequels, but this film is on par with the original. What we end up with is an Indonesian reimagining of the Departed with the hyperviolence and action sequences of a Mortal Kombat video game.  What I like most about Evans' directing style is how well he builds anticipation leading up to his…",8,"english"
"Paying more attention this time significantly raised my level of enjoyment. Gareth Evans knows all kinds of ways to break people's bodies.",9,"english"

"Sorry. No.  No knowledge of how to pace a film or construct a story is evident here. 75% of these scenes have NO impact on the plot or the main character, and are simply there because car chases dur hur hur hur  Granted, the set pieces are exciting, (some overused, however) and certain action sequences are impressive, but that's all it has going for it and that doesn't make a film. With a good script and capable direction, the cast…",3,"english"
"The Raid 2 has a couple of different titles. It’s also called The Raid 2: Berandal (the title I decided to go with), and IMDb have it listed as The Raid: Retaliation. But action movie fans can just go ahead and call it the action movie of the year. Yes, I know we’re only in the fourth month, but I can’t see anything stealing the crown from this bad boy.  Everything that you’ve already heard about The Raid 2 is…",9,"english"
"Lacking the simplistic beauty of the first film was a major concern I had with this movie. However the fight choreography is brilliant and it even features some nice camera work. I'm looking forward to what Gareth Evans does next.",9,"english"
"This could have almost worked as a stand-alone film as it's very different from the first film, but it's a great follow-up at the same time. It's a little lengthy at times, but the choreography of the fight scenes are phenomenal nonetheless. The story is really strong and there's some great new characters, and the violence is even better than it was in the first film. Let's hope Gareth Evans wants to make another!",8,"english"
"Just that little bit too violent for me I think, compounded with being so long. There was a lot there to marvel at and marvel I did, its a stunning looking film incredibly choreographed but I kind of got burnt out on it before the end which didn't happen with the first one.  I can see how it surpasses the first one, I dont really have a problem with all the 5 star reviews, I think it just got a bit too much for me tonight.",7,"english"
"This had been on the to watch pile for a very, very long time, and on Blu-Ray, such a crime. Although not as urgent as it's predecessor, 'The Raid 2' commands merit for being a film of a different calibre, in it's own right.  'The Raid' was claustrophobic, anarchistic, violent, fast paced and best of all, just plain enjoyable. Although The Raid 2 failed to replicate many of these fine qualities, it created ones all of it's own. I think…",8,"english"
"When I watched The Raid it stood out from pretty much every other action film I've seen, and it featured some of the best and most authentic looking hand to hand combat I've seen in film. So how would the sequel stand up?  Very, very well! The world is expanded outside of the tower block we spend the majority of the first film in. We get a lot more actually in terms of set. But it doesn't distract.  There's more…",9,"english"
"Relentless. Chaotic. Insane. Brutal. Thrilling...... Holy shit!.... Oh my God!.......Damn!!!........ I'm running out of adjectives to describe how incredible The Raid 2 is. How is it possible that this film managed to outdo it's predecessor? How? What's your secret Gareth Evans? This review doesn't give this movie enough justice. All I can possibly say for this film is that you need to see this film immediately. See it before the year is over.  5/5",10,"english"
"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  This is my favourite action film of all time.  Everything about it is perfect.  Its the film I have waited for since I discovered martial arts films at a young age.  Thats all I think I need to say about this film.  LONG LIVE PRAKOSO!  So I thought I could stop talking about this film but thats not working out as planned. I have to mention two scenes that I found fantastic and mesmerising. The Raid 2 was filmed immaculately.…",10,"english"
"Since everything is operating on a grander scale than in the first installment, the scenes of dialogue and longer running time are more than justified. It's also even more thrilling to watch the spectacular fight scenes take place all over the city. The fight choreography is truly amazing, and Gareth Evans knows how to work the camera in order to perfectly capture all the mayhem. He's also very skilled at getting static shots from a distance. Iko Uwais is one…",8,"english"
"Two and a half hours of glorious, ultraviolent fights. I could probably have gone for two and a half hours more of this. This is just one big bloody engine going on full throttle without looking back. Style over substance, fuck yeah. But I'll go for this style anyday.",9,"english"
"I think it's safe to say that we have no action filmmaker working today better than Gareth Evans. Right? Is that even debatable? Who else can you compare? Michael Bay substitutes true action for excessive noise and screen clutter. Ang Lee and Christopher Nolan both want to make important movies. JJ Abrams can't get his head out of his own mystery box. Justin Lin has potential, but nowhere near the pure kinetic mastery of Evans. And Zack Snyder is so…",8,"english"
"They really shot that dude in the face with a shotgun. If that doesn't earn you at least four stars, then what is any of this even all about?",8,"english"
"The most perplexingly difficult films to review are those that are at points both unequivocally jaw dropping, and at others exasperatingly prolonged. Perhaps THE RAID 2's greatest fault is taking complaints pointed at its excellent predecessor too seriously. Where that first film was propped up with minimal story and a single location, its sequel is deliriously expansive. The layered story covers everything from a dysfunctional family mob hierarchy to an all out mob war to a disastrously long, blood-soaked series…",8,"english"
"Very fun movie with incredible action scenes. Would have been so much better if they trimmed 45 minutes or so of the ""plot"" from it. But so entertaining and highly recommended.",9,"english"
"The Raid 2 is kind of like the older, taller, sexier, better looking, more mature son. Technically, better and literally larger in scope than its predecessor. But no matter how many times you try not to play favourites and how hard you try to love both equally, you know in your heart you have a favoured child - the younger, smaller, leaner one - your baby, that's The Raid for me.",8,"english"
"Replaces the lean briskness of the original with a long, operatic mob drama (I'll take the crappy deep-undercover plot line if it means nearly two solid hours of elegant skull-cracking), but sacrifices none of the expertly-crafted fight sequences. In fact, expanding the universe means expanding the sandbox, which results in truly breathtaking urban-jungle stunt work. As expected, the fights are impeccably shot and choreographed, but they're a lot wetter and a lot more brutal this time around. But Gareth Evans…",9,"english"
"Fortunately, most people in Dallas have no desire to read subtitles at the movies, so I had the entire theater all to myself. I gotta say, it was the most fun I've ever had in a long, long time.

In The Raid 2, Evans expands…",8,"english"
"The Raid times two.  Bigger, bloodier, longer and better than the first film.  More like Infernal Affairs this time as Rama goes undercover to bring down corrupt cops and brutal gangsters.  My only moan would be the under developed villians, Hammer Girl, Baseball Bat Man ad the Assassin, who it was hinted had back stories but we got nothing about them.",9,"english"
"It's funny how this has a running theme of characters going beyond their reach due to ambition/arrogance because that pretty much sums this up. Comparisons to Johnnie To are unfounded because To could cover the same ground in 100 minutes if he wasn't trying.  Evans is undeniably a fantastic action director, one of the best today, but my god this movie just PLODS through a boring, been-there-done-that crime story that amounts to nothing. Seriously, after spending 2+ hours building up…",0,"english"
"The Raid 2 is a bigger scale action flick than its predecessor which was already one of the greatest modern action movies available. I don't usually like to do this, but here are a list of problems I had with this sequel, despite really enjoying it and feeling overall it met my expectations.  - The fight scenes are less organic than in The Raid, the original set the story up within the first ten minutes and every action scene made…",6,"english"
"The moral of this story, less is more and bigger is not always better, is as old as the oral tradition itself, and unfortunately, in Gareth Evans follow up to his universally acclaimed action flick The Raid Redemption, it's pretty much the only coherent one being told.

Kitchen fight will go down in history as one of the greatest fight scenes of all time.  Negatives out of the way first so I can then gush about it. The story is convoluted and clunky in places, it's completely different to the original which is not a bad thing at all. It was a badass idea to…",9,"english"

If the opening scene sets the tone for the rest of a…",10,"english"
"The brilliance of The Raid is that it's perfect.  I mean, that's a fact. It's a perfect movie. It strips the action film down to its basest elements, discarding all the bullshit most movies they feel they need to toss our way for respectability in favor of pure violence and style.

I can think of so many movies from across the world whose screenplay involves a cop going undercover to incorporate himself into a ruthless gang, only to get swept up in a world full of violent murders, drug production, and maybe a side of betrayal.

"In the first film, Evans deliberately canceled the entire history of its characters, serving only what was required for the present to exist. The mystery around Rama's abilities induced intrigue. In the second film, Evans gets concerned with creating an entire story of gangs, gang wars, and assassins to elevate the potential of what he can serve in action. While the attempt to write a meaty, indigenous story is something to cheer for, Evans starts juggling between his priorities and…",5,"english"
"Might be the edibles but this is the best action movie of all-time ya dig",0,"english"
"This may be a controversial opinion but I think that this was better than The Raid. Pure cinematic joy with some of the best action scenes I've ever seen. Mr. Evans can direct the shit out of anything.",9,"english"
"Somehow expands on and builds upon the world and story of the first one perfectly. The action gets amped up too, everything just gets cranked up a notch for this one, every action scene, every punch, kick, stab or whatever the fuck they use to kill someone is SO satisfying to watch. They really made the first one, got some more money, and completely utilized their extra budget to make one of the most stellar action films ever made.",10,"english"
"The action/fight scenes are still top notch. However, the story is way to bloated. My main issue is the fact, that it just feels like a run of the mill action fest that offers nothing new (accept another look at a newish martial art). The first movie worked really well because of the cracking story, setting and close quarters action, this has none of that, its just a gangster flick with lots of stereotypical stuff in it. It just lacks the quality of it's predecessor and left me numb and weary. 🇲🇨  ''Only a fool argues for the pride of a dead man''",7,"english"

"Compared to the first one this one has a bigger budget, better cinematography, way more characters, story, more creative action, amazing fight choreography and more... but I don't think it's better.

Still fun though!  204/365 movies & tv for 2023",7,"english"

Is it too much to ask for Rama to have just one relaxing day?",8,"english"

"in retrospect it does seem kind of silly to take the first Raid movie and conclude that a sequel could improve upon it by adding an extra hour of extremely derivative gangster movie plot",6,"english"
"Gareth Evans follows up with a sequel to his brilliant first film but doesn’t hit the mark. Although the action and fighting is still brutally captivating it loses the claustrophobic feel of being in the tower block of the first one. Also they are all gangsters with guns if these used some now and again they could have cut the run time by about a hour.",6,"english"
"“No… I’m done.”  I love showing The Raid series to the uninitiated because it’s unlike anything in Western action… the last 40 minutes or so is pure adrenaline with some of the best fight choreography of all time. As much as I would love Gareth Evans to continue, I feel this is a perfect resolution to Rama’s character arc and the narrative as a whole.",9,"english"

"Shout out to Emma for letting me watch this because my BluRay was absolutely borked. The scope of this was tenfold compared to the first film and I enjoyed seeing the ramifications of the predecessor take place. The whole gang war focus was interesting and pretty tense but I felt like Rama was sidelined a fair bit in middle of this. But that final third was bombastically good and loved the ambiguous conclusion.",8,"english"

"The next evolution for The Raid, and after having not seen it for at least 5 years I gotta say what a great follow up.   Dialled up the action to 11, which was totally necessary and very appropriate.   Some very memorable action sequences and sets.  An interesting plot that expands on the world we didn’t get to see much of in the first movie.  There are a few things that did bother me a bit, for instance how they recasted…",10,"english"

"I'm a big fan of Gareth Evans' The Raid. While I haven't watched it as much in recent years as I have in the past, I've still probably seen it six or seven times in the years since it was first released. It's one of the best action films of the past couple of decades, and as far as I'm concerned it's as close to flawless as one could reasonably expect from the genre.  I'm significantly less familiar with the…",0,"english"
"Gareth did such an amazing job improving The Raid 2 with a compelling and comprehensive story.  With more location to shoot, more skilled and well-known actors, and finally a logical story that the first installment did not have, The Raid 2 has proven itself to be a big improvement and perhaps one of the best sequel of all time. What The Raid lack of was a story and TR 2 successfully filled it in. A lot of characters were played…",9,"english"
"The Raid 2 trades in the suspense and relentless action of the original for an epic gangster story. The increase in scope allows for a greater variety of characters and fights, though the action doesn’t truly take off until the last half hour.   There are plenty of action packed sequences before that, but often they’re between people we barely know and have no investment in, which significantly lowers the stakes. For example, the introduction of Hammer Girl and Baseball Bat…",9,"english"
"Amazing! The sequel is just as good if not better than the original movie for sure!  This time we get less fighting overall BUT we get a good plot instead of just fighting all the time in a single location with multiple floors and rooms.  The title ""The Raid"" actually fits the first movie better but now with the sequel, they took the first movies' appeal and applied it to a bigger landscape and a more complex plot and story.…",9,"english"

"A sequel that maintains the quality of its action. Gareth Evans added a lot more story this time around in a 150-minute runtime that feels undeniably drawn out and unnecessary. The fights and prison yard scenes are quite nuts and often savage at times, but that type of carnage really doesn’t occur as much as it should. It’s unfortunate to say this is a solid, but ultimately underwhelming sophomore effort from Evans. At least it features a couple of pretty kickass cameo roles from Sharkboy and Lavagirl’s grounded and admittedly more deranged cousins.",6,"english"

The Choreographers in this movie is deserve getting an Oscar imo.   The cinematography in this movie is also great, much better than before who just set in one place, but this, this is from place to place to place it's so great!! also it adds some indonesian culture in this film, and as an Indonesian i'm very proud on this film.",10,"english"
"Second time this year, and I’ll probably watch it again honestly.   My favorite action film of all time. Everything about it is perfect, and it encapsulates everything I love about the best of the genre. Insane action, well written characters, perfect direction, everything fires on all cylinders. An absolute masterpiece that floors me every time I watch it as if it’s the first time I’m seeing it.",10,"english"
"Man what can I even say. This was a damn action film masterpiece. I’m shocked honestly. It’s the perfect sequel that also feels like a standalone and is a perfect standalone. It’s fights are phenomenal with a some A1 cinematography that just made this that more amazing to watch. It’s acting and directing is so damn strong as well. But man I was not expecting this to have not only a great story but some damn good character development too…",10,"english"

It takes place immediately after the original film, which is cool, but it’s been a few months since I’ve seen the original film so a lot of information about characters and plot had been forgotten with gaps in my mind having to be made up during the films run time.

And unlike other famous sequels like Aliens and Terminator 2, this started as action and had a lot more to live up to in that aspect.

I wasn’t sure if it was imperative to have seen the first Raid movie, so I just skipped to the one that most people talk about, and from a purely action standpoint, this is a home run. This is a bone crunching, face mangling, blood spattering good time. It’s so much fun to watch some of the best fight choreography I’ve ever seen.…",8,"english"
"The way larger, way expanded sequel that puts so many to shame. Truly leaves it all on the screen and as much as I'd love a Raid 3 or even for Joe Carnahan's Zeno (basically a remake) to connect to these to further expand this criminal universe - I can live with this being the swan song. Among the best car chases (if not THE best) of the last decade. Enough bone-crunching action for an entire phase of Marvel films. Absolute extravaganza made with a love of the genres it pulling from and of its violent, fucked up world.",9,"english"

"Absolutely thrilling, brutal, and relentless. The Raid 2 took everything it’s predecessor did right and dialed it up to 11, while adding in a really well told crime story. It’s suffice to say that I wasn’t expecting this involved a story when I first saw this back in 2014, but this film having one is what puts it above Redemption for me.   The story brings even more context to what Rama is doing, really adds to the tension by not…",10,"english"
"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  It pains me slightly to deduct that half-star, as this was my favorite movie of 2014, but I must. I simply must.  The story doesn’t quite work for me anymore, and the movie doesn’t seem too concerned with Rama as a character. His motivations are never clear. He has a wife and kid he hasn’t seen in two years. Presumably Rama’s fighting endlessly to see them again, but they’re never mentioned after the first 20 minutes. And then the ending…",9,"english"

For being a sequel that carries over both the director and star of THE RAID (2011), this is an unwelcome, bloated departure from the lean premise and execution that made the first film so exceptional: 15 floors, each one more dangerous than the last, cramped quarters and improvised weapons all over the damn place.

"The Raid 2 has the best fight choreography of all time, with its predecessor being its only rival.  There are a few reasons why this is:  - They have actual martial artists playing the parts, who are surprisingly good at acting. - Pencak Silat: a unique form of martial arts rarely seen in movies that is as beautiful and slick as it is brutal. - You can tell it wasn't choreographed in a box; the artists make great use of…",10,"english"
"Trading action for story, The Raid 2 is an improvement over it's predecessor because of the well thought out storyline and character development that was missing in the last film.

"The Raid is one of my favourite action films of recent years, and it’s definitely the best choreographed and most satisfying to watch. Once a sequel was announced I was ecstatic, especially after watching the trailer that showed that it was looking to be a huge step up from the original.

"The Raid 2 is a supersized version of its predecessor. Every element of The Raid: Redemption is blown up and expanded for The Raid 2, with the addition of a more complex, layered plotline.  Now, this plotline isn't anything special. Gareth Evans proves to be a competent director of an undercover, crossed-gangs thriller, but not an amazing one. The story built into The Raid 2 is functional, but isn't emphasized, and though I don't think the film is dramatically overlong,…",8,"english"
"The pair of Raid movies seem to attract an inexplicable hyperbole. Claimed the best action movies ever, I struggle to see what makes them worthy outside of the intricacy of the stunts, which isn’t necessarily anything new. The first is okay.

"When it sticks to visceral violence and kinetic action The Raid 2 is a really fun and entertaining film, it has balletic brutality and a propulsive sense of pleasure. Unfortunately, Gareth Evans seems far more enthralled with Michael Mann and Infernal Affairs than his stream-lined original. It is to the detriment of his own sequel.

"Gareth Evans' violent crime world grows considerably larger in this sequel and somehow manages to top the ridiculousness and complexity of the original. The direction feels more polished and focused this time around. Every scene is shot beautifully and the set-ups leading to each fight gives the action more weight and an undeniable feeling of epicness. The overall length was an issue for some, but I couldn't get enough. Evans could have pushed the runtime to three hours and I'd still be saying I wanted more.

"While not a bolt out of the blue like The Raid (Redemption) was, Bernadal is a nasty reminder why Gareth Evans is the most entertaining action director working. Instead, this is a brilliantly observed and rendered Yakuza film, so naturally, it's slower and more deliberate than its older sibling. The violence has been taken up a level, which seemed impossible two years ago. Berandal is full of stabby nastiness. Not only that, Evans and co have become better at choreography…",10,"english"
"This review original appeared on 365daysofreviews.wordpress.com:  In 2011 writer/director Gareth Evans and actor Iko Uwais made their presence known to the martial arts film community with an Indonesian feature known in the US as The Raid: Redemption. The movie starred Uwais as Rama, one of 20 police officers charged with storming an tenement building with the express purpose of taking down crime boss Tama Riyadi (Ray Sahetapy). The picture plays out like a standard video game, complete with mini bosses…",9,"english"
"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  There's two reason I need to see this again.  1. Cineworld Milton Keynes completely fucked up the opening 15/20 minutes. They'd somehow managed to display it in the wrong aspect ratio and this meant half of the subtitles were missing. You could read them but it took a little longer so you couldn't really relax. Whilst trying to fix the issue they tried to change the focus and eventually turned the entire screen black just leaving the audio. I'm one…",10,"english"
"My timing for seeing THE RAID 2 is quite funny, as this has been one of my most anticipated movies for so long - pretty much ever since I saw the first film - and then just a few days ago CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER blew me away, and left me talking about how I couldn't imagine a more rewarding action movie being released this year. All of a sudden THE RAID 2 had even bigger expectations to meet:…",10,"english"
"Gareth Evans is a super talented guy - there is no doubt about that. When it comes to choreographing action, he is definitely one of the best in the game and the way he stages mayhem will be imitated for years to come. That is why I like RAID 1 so much, because it set a new standard on how to make a movie where you have a great set-up with all the necessary stakes involved and then just kick…",6,"english"
"The fight scenes confirm Evans' status as the Minnelli of mayhem, his camera and editing fluidly combining with the outrageous physical feats of his cast. If Michael Jackson were still alive, I suspect he'd be beating down the Welshman's door to shoot a music video.

"It's been a while since I saw the Raid: Redemption but I'm confident in saying this is probably the better movie. Some people dislike the actual plot but I loved it. There's a lot of intrigue and drama to go around and I didn't find any of it confusing or bloated. I'm a sucker for a Sleeping Dogs story though.  The cinematography was some good shit. I liked all the symmetrical stuff going on with some Kubrick-esque shots. Something to…",10,"english"
"I liked ""The Raid 2"" quite a bit. All the ultraviolent skull-smashing, blood-splattering action of the original, and there's a better plot that's not just a retread of the first film. There's also a more interesting and colorful set of characters. Expanding to multiple locales and adding some intense car action helped a lot.",9,"english"
"I expected myself to love this more, considering that The Raid is probably one of my favorite action films, but The Raid 2 shows that bigger and more expansive isn't always better. It made me long for the confined spaces and gradual buildup of the original film, both of which are almost completely nonexistent in this sequel. The action is as good as it's ever been but the inclusion of a more sprawling, and ultimately extremely dull, narrative just didn't…",6,"english"

"""Hi, I'm Gareth Evans, and I'm here to talk to you about a problem I've been noticing in a lot of movies lately. Heck, why beat around the bush: this is something I've been noticing in all movies ever. Here it is: let's say you're watching a movie, and the ownage gets going, and lots of guys start getting killed. What's wrong with this picture? I'll tell you what: how do you know those guys are dead? Like really, really…",8,"english"
"My complaints from the first go are pretty much the same, but I like this film even less on this rewatch. Does anyone in this film actually think about using their guns when someone is coming at them with nothing but fists? The fights in the first one made a lot of sense, but here there are characters (or rather living punching bags) who by all means should have guns on them to shoot the guys coming at them with a baseball bat (at best). It just makes the film cartoonish, and in a way that doesn't gel with Evan's gritty style.",0,"english"
"Bigger, tougher, longer and with an added panto villain, The Raid 2 is as excruciating to watch (in a good way) as its predecessor, yet it's almost a victim of its own success, as the pace of the first simply never lets up, which was its strength. One can only marvel at the inventiveness of the brutal fight scenes - the finale in the kitchen is breathtaking! The call for a movie prequel with Hammer Girl and Baseball Bat Man starts here!",7,"english"
"Whatever you do, do not watch a foreign language film with English dubs.  By accident I watched a version of The Raid 2 with English dubs. It probably ruined every performance and the personalities of the characters in the film. Each scene with drama was like a cutscene from a game that had mediocre and dull voice acting. I'm sure The Raid 2 is a very good film, but not when each character is dubbed with lifeless English voices.  The…",6,"english"
"Do you want hardcore fights? Do you want to wince at violence? Then The Raid 2 is for you! This blood-filled masterpiece is unlike anything else out there. It takes place shortly after the events in The Raid, and Rama has to go undercover to protect his family. This movie is 2 hrs and 30 mins of ""whoa"" and ""ouch."" So, whether you are already a fan of or new to this genre, this film will punch, kick, and stomp its way into your heart.",8,"english"
"Somehow better than its predecessor. The first cemented Gareth Evans as an action director but this one cemented him as a storyteller. It is brilliantly made. The best chase and fight scenes that have ever been in an action film. It may seem hyperbolic but considering this was almost two weeks ago and I'm still riding the adrenaline high then it's the real deal. Well fucking done.  Look for Arifin Putra in Hollywood soon.",10,"english"
"You are not ready for this movie. You can't be.  The Raid 2 (or The Raid: Berandal) is the followup to Gareth Evan's much beloved The Raid: Redemption, which crashed on to the action movie scene around 2012. The sequel is more ambitious and more satisfying in almost every way. Evans has done a rare thing with this sequel; he's improved on the original in nearly every way without losing what sight of what made it great.  And what makes…",9,"english"
"How do you follow up one of the best action movies of recent years?  Well, if The Raid 2 is anything to go by, you widen the scope as much as is humanly possible. Whilst the first film played out almost entirely within a single tower block, this majestic sequel is a sprawling underworld tale that is anything but agoraphobic.  Iko Uwais shows that he's more than just flying fists with a surprisingly nuanced performance as Rama. In The Raid,…",10,"english"

"I admit I haven't seen the number of martial arts films as a lot of genre buffs, but I have seen my fair share of the best of Bruce Lee, Sammo Hung, Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Tony Jaa, etc. pictures and I can say without a doubt Raid 2 has the best fight choreography I've ever seen by some margin. It also adds an actual compelling story, riffing on Infernal Affairs and Drug War, to the spectacular violence and breathless suspense, making for one of the best action movies in many years.",8,"english"

The action was amazing with the choreography being great and the way how the camerawork was done was also great, the acting was solid, the background score was great(especially during the ending of the film), the story was expanded and well done, the opening was great, the ending was also great and etc! Iko Uwais was great as Rama again and I enjoyed his scenes! Yayan Ruhian and Cecep Arif Rahman were also great! The…",10,"english"
"Absolutely gorgeous and brutal, epic sprawling crime saga with all the martial arts combat you can handle. Feels reminiscent of an old Fukasaku style Yakuza flicks. There's steady beautiful politics and back stabbing and partying. There's motion and shaking camera during the action. Cool camera tricks, great balance of story w action, seemingly lethal stuntman work. Iko Uwais gains legend status because of The Raid 1 & 2. I wish more people would invest in the long run time to experience this because it doesn't feel like when watching it.",10,"english"

"I have been wanting to watch this movie for years, but I haven't had the time to see it. Now that it's on Netflix, I can say that it delivered what I expected for this sequel. If I were to rate this based on the action scenes; this would get five stars. The fight in the kitchen is one of the best action sequences that I've ever seen on film! I also appreciated that Raid 2 went in a completely…",8,"english"

"I watched this movie for the action I knew it had. I’d never seen The Raid 2 before, so I did not know that it also had a super good story that went along with it.  The movie does not feel like it is two and a half hours because of how fun it is, and there were only a couple of parts that felt slow. Other than them, this movie is full steam ahead the entire time. Every single…",7,"english"
"Part of me was kinda worried this wouldn’t hold up, safe to say that part of me is elated, it’s even better than I remembered. An action film on an epic scale, feels almost like a Johnnie To film infused with some of the best action you’ll ever see. The main selling point is definitely the action, however, everything else here is top notch. Every part of the films world feels fully realized and a lot of that comes down…",10,"english"

"In many ways this is just as solid as its predecessor even if I enjoy the simplicity of the first movie. The second movie provides a more complex and enjoyable plot and with a bigger budget the action sequences are even better. My apprehension to embrace this as being the better of the two is because of how much I enjoyed the simplicity of the first film. I would love to give this one a rewatch and I think I…",8,"english"

"its kinda hard watching any other action movie after the raid movies. the choreography is just on a whole other level. this time around the story takes a much greater focus instead of it just being straightforward with the action taking center stage. the characters feel more fleshed out and the story by itself is very interesting. the cinematography is even a lot better this time. i swear this movie felt like the godfather if it was an action flick.…",9,"english"
"Maybe it’s just the weird ass Spanish dub that HBO has for whatever reason, but I found this to be a massive slog compared to the first raid, which is a lightning fast 101 minutes, where as this feels like 150 minutes in the hyperbolic time chamber wading through quicksand, and occasionally Goku is there beating the shit out of someone. I didn’t hate it, I just didn’t love it as much as I was expecting. The camera work in…",7,"english"
"this man grilling not patties but fucking humans  42%  “The Raid 2” is certainly not the worst, but it feels, uselessly put together to put everything the director previously couldn’t. Majorly a story, we follow the officer again in a new adventure that gets confusing and digs itself into its overdramatized story of gangs, spies, and family. But it doesn’t really do much with it’s doubled runtime except for the well done but a lot less connected to its brutality. It feels like a vanity project to remake “The Raid” but more, and more, but the more it adds, the more it feels bloated bore.",4,"english"
"i wasn’t sure about the raid 2 at first. the action was as good as it’s ever been, but it was only a few scenes between padding of tons of dialogue that i didn’t really understand or care too much about.  however, as the movie went on, i could feel the intensity growing. action scenes got bloodier, and more frequent. characters got more and more on edge, more angry. the violence of the movie felt like it was trying to…",9,"english"
"I didn't think they could possibly top the first one, but I stand corrected. The choreography and cinematography, are on a whole other level when it comes to action movies. Keeping the action on screen at all times is definitely the way to do it. Someone get Gareth Evans and his team to do a proper Mortal Kombat film damn it!",10,"english"
"The raid 2 is certainly bigger. The fight scenes are able to shine more with how diverse the situations and sets are. The raid 1 is spectacular in its choreography, but nonetheless felt restrained with it being confined in pretty samey hallways and rooms. Here we have brawls in clubs, car chases and gang shootouts. The action directing does not slow down whatsoever with this change in scope. And same goes for the choreography, the grittiness and the oomph of…",7,"english"
"Still super fun but it’s less of a “raid” more of an inside-man thing and without the literal leveling up linear structure of the first one it gets so caught up in the going ons of the baddies we don’t connect as much to Rama’s journey. But, again, still super fun! Minimum 5 unimpeachable action scenes.",7,"english"

"Arguably the finest action film the 21st century has yet to offer.",10,"english"
"This bad boy really just takes the first movie and 1-ups everything in its sight. The cinematography is far cleaner, especially in the editing department, and camera movements are kicked up to maximum overdrive to follow the speed of all the action taking place. Set pieces are much more elaborate and characters are fleshed out enough so that there’s a reason to the madness unlike the first.  Earlier I said The Raid was the best action movie of all time…",10,"english"

"Wow. The fighting in the first one is incredible, the fighting in this one is nauseating and suffocating. Heart pounding and edge of my seat for real Was a little too long and the plot was a little too convoluted, but jeez dude lol. This thing is formidable. The best fighting I have ever seen in a movie bar none",9,"english"
"fuck it, the meat of this film outweights everything else",0,"english"
"If there was ever such thing as too much bat shit crazy amazing action than it would probably be this  Luckily there is no such thing... Easily better than the first one in my opinion, I love how it just gets pushed to the next level with a much larger scale and even bigger fight scenes...like goddamn the fights in the prison and on the train are some of the best ever  Gareth Evans needs to make 1 more and make it a trilogy, these are just too good",9,"english"
"Action is still unparalleled. First seeing this years ago I literally left the theater shaking from excitement, this watch was hardly different.",9,"english"
"Perhaps a little cumbersome at times; the Prakoso storyline especially felt like it wasn’t integrated very gracefully with the rest of the plot (also: random snow in Indonesia? Am I missing something?). Arifin Putra’s sideburns really helped complete that look. Rama vs. Hammergirl and Batboy felt like the highlight of the film to me. There’s a bad suicide squad joke in there that I’m going to refrain from writing down.",7,"english"
"The action choreography might be the best I have ever seen in this one. This sequel expands the world in a meaningful way and quickly establishs the amazing scenario of the film, placing Rama undercover in a prison to befriend the son of a mob boss. It’s rare an action film can keep escalating their action scenes in a way that makes the next better than the last. While nothing meets the peak of the series fight with Mad Dog from the first film, I am so glad this was my 400th new film of the year.",10,"english"
"Amazing sequel. Takes everything you love about the first film and cranks it up several notches. Sure, it’s a little on the long side, but there’s so much blood, violence and amazing fight sequences that the run time flies by.",10,"english"

"Not since Quentin Tarantino’s “Kill Bill: Vol. 1” have I felt so exhilarated after having seen an action picture packed with glorious violence that is very gruesome but actually highly entertaining—even if its running time is a hundred fifty minutes. Written and directed by Gareth Evans, do not be fooled by the synopses of “The Raid 2: Berandal.” It is not just a movie for men. It is a movie for everyone who can appreciate visual acrobatics through martial arts.…",10,"english"

"I’m not sure how I would rank this against its predecessor, but this film does a damn good job of innovating on the first film in terms of making the action sequences feel fresh and new, which i’d say is tough considering how much the first film showcased in terms of combat sequences.",8,"english"
"The raid 2 minimizes all issues I have with action movies and masters everything else. The story is just good enough to justify all the action sequences, but that's actually all I want in this kind of movie. It's great how the raid 2 can build tension before every action scene. The actual fighting is stunning and the sound fits perfect. The kitchen scene is the best choreography I've ever seen. The raid 2 outdoes all the US action films without becoming harebrained.",9,"english"
"The Raid 2 – 8/10  If you are going to make a sequel, this is the way to approach it. A huge expansion of a small and minimalistic plot. The thing that lets it down slightly is that they slightly overwrote it. The simplicity of the first one was a huge part of what made it work so well. This one is a little hard to follow in places.  All of that does not really matter though, as we are…",8,"english"
"Some of the sickest martial arts I have ever seen plus an incredible car chase. There's a mean-ass heart beating inside this movie, and it warns you right away by killing everyone the hero fought the whole first movie to save. No one gets out of this alive. If you're a good guy you can push yourself out past the limits of your body and hurt the head of evil, but that's just one head, and that's just once. The last shot of this movie makes it clear: there's still another entire crime empire to fight, but our guy? Our guy is done.",9,"english"

"Rewatched to ‘research’ for a martial arts script im writing.  This is still an action masterpiece. I personally prefer this to the first movie cause it adds a crazy epic crime plot on top of all the perfect action of the first film.

"Despite seeing the original countless times, this was shamefully my first viewing of it's more acclaimed sequel, and I must say I wasn't disappointed in the slightest.  The Raid 2 makes a risky genre and structure shift from it's predecessor. Whereas Redemption is a no frills and all thrills rollercoaster ride with just enough plot to be considered a narrative, The Raid 2 is far more ambitious. It's a soapy crime drama almost as much as it is an action…",9,"english"
"What more could I ask for in an action film?  It takes everything great about the first film and multiplies it by 100. More action, more locations, more story, and more badass characters.  And it's 40 minutes longer.",10,"english"

"Uco is so fucking extra to the guy that’s offering him tissue paper.  He insults the guy, basically yanks the whole roll out of the poor guys hand while taking some, yanks it again to get some more, throws the whole roll on the ground, and then while the guy is picking it up he throws the tissue paper he had in his hands at him.  This guy doesn’t make minimum wage to get sassed by a pussy ass bitch like Uco.",9,"english"
"Doesn't hit with quite the same forcefulness as it used to now that Timo Tjahjanto went and put everyone on notice; still a facemelter. The car chase to the end is non-stop excellence.",9,"english"
"I have 0 complaints. I swear, everything about this film absolutely moved me. What usually lacked in Hollywood action movies, you can find them here, enhanced and crafted beautifully by Mr. Evans. No more talking just please oh please go see the movie!!!",10,"english"
"While I prefer the tauter, more streamlined approach of The Raid, this sequel is still an incredible experience. Top-notch choreography, dynamic editing, impressive cinematography, and astonishing direction all help cement The Raid 2 as an excellent film in and of itself.  The only real downside is that the epic scope of the film hinders its pacing in numerous places.",8,"english"
"I was a bit too hard on this based on my first viewing. Come on past self! Dis is some gud shite!  It’s honestly too long and the plot plays like a fan fiction remake of The Departed, but the action is basically violence porn in the steamiest and sexiest way possible.   I mean, there’s a scene where a dude unloads an entire clip of an uzi into a motorcyclist’s face, because oh why not....  If that’s not love at first sight, I don’t know what is.",8,"english"

"My brain just got raped by how well shot, choreographed, acted, and edited everything in this movie is. View it like Kill Bill, this sequel isn't just a second outing, but very much the second half of an amazing story. Keeps the taut action while boosting the character development and introduces interesting politics. Michael Bay, you might wanna take some notes",9,"english"
"This film is physically exhausting to watch.",10,"english"
"Holy shit. I loved this so much better than the first. The action doesn’t let up in this high stakes sequel to the original hit. How about a shout-out to “Hammer Bitch!” She was bad! Probably my favorite character. I literally allowed a whole cup of coffee to go cold because I was so engrossed and on the edge of my seat. So much to like and so many great scenes: the toilet, the mud riot, the car, the kitchen, etc.",10,"english"

"While The raid was a completely unique action frenzy, its sequel is a far more conventional film. There's nothing wrong with that. As far as ""cop in deep cover"" crime thrillers go, this is one of the best. This is because of two main reasons.  One, it's just an excellent movie all round.

"Hands down, probably my favorite Action Film of all time. The choreography of the fight scenes is unlike anything else I've seen, the cinematographic tools being utilized here find exactly the right beat for each and every single scene and what I may like the most is the purposefully vague story telling. The events and characters here feel like they could be from a Greek tragedy - something that gives the action as well as the slower sequences a dramatic…",10,"english"

It was one of the most brutal, exhilarating, and bonkers films I have ever seen. The sequel The Raid 2 does not disappoint. The violence is waaaay more brutal, frenetic, and grandiose. However, the action in this sequel is a bit more spaced out. Don't get me wrong, the action set pieces are great but I think…",9,"english"
"Like Infernal Affairs meets A Bittersweet Life. As a gangster movie, I found it limited. As a pure action spectacle, it was incredibly engrossing and utterly relentless in the best way possible. What I appreciate beside the fight choreography, is Gareth Evans' eye.

Picking up right after the first Raid film, Raid 2 sends our hero into the gangster underground to help a secret cop branch weed out bad cops getting paid for turning a blind eye to organized crime.

"I am a huge fan of The Raid: Redemption (2011). I think it's one of the best action films of the past few years. I loved how confined the setting was and that it didn't waste a single minute of screen time. It was just non-stop onslaught from start to finish.

"The Raid 2 takes a sidestep into gangster family drama, all interspersed with action scenes on a par with the first one.  Just as well, I don't think they could have pulled off the same trick twice.

It's still a brilliant piece of action cinema.",9,"english"
"Having really enjoyed The Raid: Redemption I had reasonably high expectations of The Raid 2, but I think the sequel doesn't reach the level of its predecessor. I found the characters and situations in The Raid 2 less convincing (as far as this genre can be credible ㋡).  The fight scenes were not as tense and adrenalin-inducing as the fights in part 1.

Martial arts movies aren't traditionally my thing, but sometimes a film can transcend its genre when it's as undeniably good as The Raid 2 is.",8,"english"

The second takes the baseline set in place from the first, and ups the ante in fight sequences and engaging story. What we have here, is a thrilling sequel.  This film becomes something akin to The Departed. The story is more complex, and we become more intune with the emotional impact on our main character.

"Takes the limited scope of its predecessor and ramps it up ten fold. Occasionally, this is to the movie's detriment; the 148 minute running time is excessive and the plot can get too convoluted for its own good.

Punch walls – they don’t retaliate.  ‘Berandal’ means ‘badass’ or ‘scoundrel’. Suck it up, don’t fuck it up. Indonesian police corruption really blows.

"The Raid is an all-time classic, so its sequel had a high bar. The Raid 2 addresses this by tweaking its approach, broadening the scope into a multigenerational gangster saga and expanding the action beyond the enclosed, hand-to-hand brawls that were the bread and butter of its predecessor. This was a smart move, and the story is complex, but involving, as we pick up with previous protagonist Rama (Iko Uwais), as he is forced to befriend gangster's son Uco (Arifin…",9,"english"

This should've killed off the genre because it's so fucking great and I've not seen anything since that has come close to being this good when it comes to its action. It's perfect. I get a rush seeing this sort of action and it's fucking great.  Masterpiece movie!",10,"english"
"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  This is as good as action movies get for me. An absolute tour de force masterpiece. This movie is absolutely nuts. Toilet fight, rad. Muddy prison fight, amazing. Koso fighting and killing everyone, righteous. Hammer girl and baseball boy, delightful. Car chase/fight with a crash through that median building that collapes, ridiculous. Final fight with curved knife guy, jawdropping. This movie is stunning. The coreography and editing are once again perfection. So many wonderful camera movements. Absolutely badass. Mad respect for all the actors/stuntpeople in this movie, they are incredible.",10,"english"

"Pretty underwhelming when compared to the first, but still a great action flick with comically long choreographed fights and great camera work. The one hitch, though, is that it's boring as hell.

"No… I’m done.  Not following in the previous films flaws of being thin on character and plot, Evans’ followup is actually something more than just a lean and tout ass-kicking powerhouse, and gives those ass-kicking sequences much more of an emotional tensity.  The Raid 2 is a grand opera of carnage, and deceit, letting you take moments of breathe before throwing you back into the bulls den of bone-breaking, beautifully idealized fight choreography that’ll have you rewind every frame in wonder of just how in the fuck a human body can withstand any of that.  Yeah, this is an absolute watch.",10,"english"
"While reportedly conceptualised before the first Raid movie, this actually feels like a reaction to what some did not like about it. There is more character development, a more complex story (involving working undercover to take down crooked cops) and more drama in between the fights. The sequel nevertheless remains a disappointment two viewings later. The claustrophobia of the first film is sorely missed and the slower pacing reduces any sense of urgency.

I think this film has some more iconic and memorable action scenes and that is definitely helped out by how stretched apart they are. The families and their personal endeavors and…",10,"english"
"Finally, Evans turned The Raid into a cool mob flick that actually has story. Aside from pacing all of the aspects in this movie are solid including the drama and ESPECIALLY the camerawork.   And I’m happy with the dialogue here. It’s not rigid and awkward anymore, which is the reason the drama is enjoyable",8,"english"

So, it is really surprising that its sequel manages to do the impossible and actually outdo its predecessor. The action is off the charts and the choreography for every fight is spectacular.

This has a little of everything: fun fights, prison brawls, car chases, espionage, crime lords, sign language using henchmen (my favorite kind)... the list goes on and on.

"definitely an improvement over the first in some ways, but there's still issues I have with this that make me prefer the first one over this. the focus on a story is great here and a nice change of pace over the LITERAL non stop action of the previous. idk why but I found myself comparing elements to the plot in this to election by Johnnie to and eastern promises by David Cronenberg. these are both movies I love and…",9,"english"

"It's like The Godfather with martial arts. Gareth Evans' follow up to the game-changing Raid is brutally elegant, ambitious, overly-long, and heaves under an epic if unoriginal story.

Going undercover, he has to dive into the criminal underworld of Jakarta…",10,"english"

"The cinematography and music are much improved compared to The Raid. However, the movie really drags on after the halfway point, but luckily the final fight sequence is satisfying enough to excuse that in my opinion. There are just way more characters to balance this time around, and that slightly drags the movie down. The first one was almost an hour shorter, and I wish this one was too. The mud fight was by far my favorite, but it happens in the…",8,"english"

The action is more brutal, bloodier and taken to next level, the plot is strong and again the choreography of its fights and it's camera work is a standout. The one on one fight sequence set in a kitchen is without a doubt one of the best fights to see on film.

"Aiming for a different, more pathos driven feature for the sequel than the first film, Gareth Evans puts so much into this film. This does expand the runtime, but I truly believe he made an incredible action, martial-arts film with the DNA of a gangster film. The plight of Uco is palpable. His privilege, anger and pride are all raw nerves that he can't dull. It brings him to a corruption arc that is clear and vibrant, even with insane…",9,"english"

It’s just so fuckin cinematic.…",9,"english"
"I miss the simplicity of the first one  When Gareth Evans tries to tell a story like he does here I don’t think it quite works out. The first one had a minimalist plot, it wasn’t complicated, that’s why it worked, but the sequel tries to be elaborate with conspiracies and twist and turns and betrayals.

"While the action in this is comparable to the first film, the Raid 2 forgets what made the original film so great, its simplicity and pacing.  The first Raid was a very simple film, the good guys have to get from A to B to take out the bad guy. There were some subplots and undertones but nothing that overcomplicated the premise.

Iko Uwais is the best in the game, his choreography skills are unmatched and so brutal and unique. The cinematography and camera work took a huge step up here as well.

The first Raid movie is a classic, marrying terrific fight choreography, stunts, artful cinematography to a great high concept, one location, one crazy night story that constantly ratchets up the tension.

It’s unfathomable to me that Evans went from the first Raid to making an epic, Michael Mann-esque, sprawling crime drama on TOP of pretty much the best martial arts film ever made.

"The Raid was a simple story of a bunch of dudes fighting in an apartment building. The Raid 2 is a sprawling, two and a half hour crime drama that somehow works.  The plot follows the hero from The Raid as he goes undercover in a crime syndicate just as a gang war is beginning to break out. The acting and drama here works better than one would think.  The real attraction in The Raid 2 is the action which…",10,"english"
"Deserves it's place in the best action movie of this decade club alongside Mad Max: Fury Road and Mission Impossible: Fallout.  This movie makes the first Raid look like amateur hour. Evans steps up his game in every department and it shows. Story, cinematography, stunts, character, and action all blend together in this masterwork. This is an action epic that is relentessly well shot and filled to the brim with all the gory violence and stunts you ever need. It…",10,"english"
"a symphony of blood and tears.",8,"english"
"I think I prefer the more contained and intimate tone of the first film, which I think creates a more personal, relatable connection between you and Rama. However, I think The Raid 2 has a legitimately good screenplay with some not-completely-cliché points to make about ambition, which I think builds on the themes of the first film in a pretty concise and logical way.",9,"english"

"Hadn't seen this in a while so I watched it again, with my friend Roberto for his first time, today in Berlin. So badass, so brutal, so bloody. Forgot how awesome the score by Joe Trapanese is. The kitchen & prison yard fights, car chase scenes are still the best ever. This film is also soooooo long, too long when you're watching it just to be amused by the fights. But it's still extremely ambitious and nothing else like it in terms of fight scenes.",8,"english"

"I don't know which one is better. They are both amazing. This one has more pmit to it but still kicks ass but it didn't feel as raw as the first which is different but is also good. This movie was great and I loved it. Literally never slows down and actually has some amazing action sequences. One of the best car chases I've ever seen and the dude with the bat and the girl with the hammers..... It's all so great. This is seriously a kick ass fun movie.",9,"english"
"Revitalizing the fading Asian ultraviolent action/thriller, Welsh writer/director Gareth Evans gives us a riveting sequel to his hit apartment-busting fight-fest, The Raid. Despite a scattered start that begins only two hours after the end of its predecessor, it soon focuses on its gangster/mafia core which seems to be the optimal recipe for this genre. Our hero, Rama, must go undercover to identify and expose police collusion with the mafia, which doesn't really involve any ""raid""-ing, but makes for a solid…",8,"english"
"Even though the overall plot in this movie is more political and slowly built compared to the first one, it still provides as much dope action. Every fight was choreographed so well, the early bathroom fight and the car extraction scene were easily my favorite parts of the movie. It’s cool that this and the previous movie can have very different tones overall, yet both be really cool to watch, both pretty violent as well.",9,"english"
"Having all the same fun elements of the first hashed around a lengthy and uninteresting plotline nips a few fun points. Far far too long but leaving the best parts for last , leaves the film on a high note.",6,"english"

"What an accomplishment. Where do you even go from here, Gareth Evans?  This truly is filmmaking at its most brutal, brilliant, brave, bold, creative and inventive. You could talk about the cinematography alone for days, not to mention the most visceral fight scenes ever put to film, which are rivaling, if not putting to shame, some of the best heroic bloodshed by John Woo out there.  This is a major step up for Evans in every way. Brilliant visuals, a…",10,"english"
"The Raid 2 has the most insane choreography I've ever seen. In-flipping-sane. Ohhhhh myyyyyy lorddddd I couldn't keep me eyes off those fight scenes. Every kick, every punch and every head smash was filmed to absolute perfection. Martial arts have never looked this thrilling since...ever. Massive props to Gareth Evans, I tip my SnapBack off to you sir! So in this sequel we follow our sole survivor, Rama, who must go undercover in order to protect his family from his…",8,"english"

"Despite loving The Raid, I didn't see this at the cinema on account of its tremendous length. I got it the week it came out on DVD and yet, again on account of its tremendous length, it sat on my To Watch pile for (I think?) a record-smashing two years.

"After watching ‘The Raid’ I had a conversation with my sister as to why, despite admiring its technical virtues, I didn’t find it as exciting as I’d hoped and we came to the conclusion that the lack of real plot meant I wasn’t sufficiently invested in the characters for their peril to have enough weight to be genuinely exciting. That problem is, in the most part, dealt with here, as Rama goes from being the sexy hero to the likeable…",7,"english"
"Picks up where the first Raid left off: story-wise, thematically, and in terms of style. The filmmakers here were focused on expanding the scope of the story: whereas the first film took place entirely inside one building, there are multiple locations and sets used for 2, reflecting the increased budget: $4.5 million US, 4 times the budget of 1. And whereas in the first film the protagonists had a single goal (get out), the protagonist in this movie has multiple…",10,"english"
"Gareth Evans remains, to me, a genius. The second Raid film delivers senseless violence at a higher budget and for an extra hour. I will also mention that I was impressed with the sound design, considering Indonesian films to be notoriously lacking in this department, although it's likely that it was handled by an outside company especially with Sony's involvement.  Fun Fact: the incredible car chase scene takes place within the neighborhood I grew up in.",8,"english"

I look forward to seeing what happens in the third installment, and how the storytelling is approached.",10,"english"

"The Raid 2 belongs in the company of Aliens, Terminator 2: Judgement Day and The Godfather Part II as one of the greatest sequels ever made.  The first film followed a simple premise of SWAT team against a tower block full of criminals all working for one drug lord. The Raid 2 picks things up a few hours after the events of the first film, and this time we are taken on a much more expansive journey through the criminal…",10,"english"
"Action with a capital A. The story is somewhat a generic excuse to have action scene after action scene ('undercover cop caught in gang war relations' type deal), but it's well-constructed with some decently written, albeit stock characters.  But this is an action film, and the action is spectacular, varied, and never-ending. Roll on The Raid 3. We need more back-to-basics, gritty, practical effects-driven action films like this.",9,"english"
"Cared even less for the plot the second time round.  Slows down so much between the fight scenes that I barely cared for those :-( Plus they are quite repetitive, breaking arm, kicking leg, breaking arm all day long.  But then the last two fight scenes arrive and they are perfectly shot, have drama, are visually interesting and in the kitchen fight the music builds and builds and builds and it's amazing.  5 Stars for the last two fight scenes, the rest I'm just not interested in I'm sorry to say.",6,"english"
"I wonder how long Liam Neeson would last in a Gareth Evans movie. Less than a second, I guess. Anyway, utter coolness during the train fight with a deaf chick wearing huge sunglasses and using two hammers. Part of an ultra violent sequence with highly creative, ferocious action.

Okay, now that the air has finally reached my lungs after a two and a half hour slugfest of blood, punches, kicks, sticks, knives, hammers, and baseball bats I can come to say that 'The Raid 2' is the greatest action movie I have ever seen!

I want to get in, I want to be dazzled by stunts and action, and I want to leave before fatigue and boredom sets in. I could have dealt with an hour being cut.

"If raid one wasn't enough action for you,see this one to blow your brains out.This movie is clearly not for the butthurt people,cause the best action movie of 2014 has to have a lotta cracking and breaking. What makes the sequel better is that the characters introduced are so intense that they could have their own spinoffs. From a fight in a jail bathroom to one inside a car and a girl hammering men (i mean literally with fucking claw hammer)in a moving train. Raid 2 really gets you pumped up and makes you wanna punch the shit outta the wall in front of you.",8,"english"
"The most rad, exciting, visually beautiful and daring action movie I've ever seen.",10,"english"
"Initial thoughts can be found here. Still a visceral, artful stunner which goes beyond its fierce choregraphy, but also at how Evans accessess smaller details in the mise en scène. For instance, decreasing a sequence's pace as he focuses on pattered raindrops (the muddy prison brawl) or a door screw coming undone (Rama awaiting the charge) appear wonderfully observed. Evans strives for ""ambition"" and demolishes his sense of ""limitation"", so to speak. Sure, there's not much innovation in going undercover…",8,"english"
"I think almost nothing gives me as much joy as watching Iko Uwais beat the ever living snot out of stupid henchmen one by one. It's simply stunning to watch and is shot and edited to perfection under the guidance of director Gareth Evans.

"I've seen it twice this week to try to grasp how insanely incredible this movie is. Every 10 minutes has a jaw-dropping action sequence that makes it, probably, the most impressive action/fighting movie EVER. Yes, you heard that right. It's simply unbelievable in a way that it's hard to imagine an action movie that could top this level of awesomeness.",10,"english"
"Worries that a rewatch would result in a less positive reaction from me were quickly quelled when Rama smashes a dude's head into a toilet. The Raid 2 is an action masterpiece, an epic mob film that an stand with the very best. Blistering martial arts fight sequences are supported by a well paced, well constructed story full of twists, turns and interesting characters. It's two and a half hours and it flew by. If only we didn't have to wait so long for the final entry in the trilogy.",10,"english"
"Fucking brilliant.  The end.",10,"english"
"I'm not sure I actually liked the addition of more story this time around. It didn't really add much except more talky scenes, and it was pretty basic corruption and gangster type stuff. That said, the action scenes were every bit as hard-hitting, well-choreographed, and awesome as before, so I still had a great time watching it.",0,"english"
"The film nearly surpasses the first one. Every time you think the film reaches its peak, there is another action scene which surpasses the previous one. The fighting choreography is amazing. Never has there been anything like this on screen. Only the shaky camera is sometimes annoying.",9,"english"
"The Raid 2 has fantastic acting, wonderful drama, and an intruding story line, but there is nothing more interesting in the film than the action sequences. No matter how much I liked the very well done plot-driven scenes, I was just patiently waiting through them to get to the part where A GIRL BEATS A GROUP OF MEN TO DEATH WITH HAMMERS ON A SUBWAY. So yeah, watch this movie if you want to see that (you do).",10,"english"
"Just as action packed and intense as the first Raid. I was absolutely mesmerized from word go. I would have gladly sat for another hour watching the non stop action and rooting for Rama. Prison fights, ruthless gangsters, a chick with hammers...love it, love everything about it. And that dude with the baseball bat is a beast.",10,"english"
"A sequel which uses its increased budget to magnify the flaws of the first film, Raid 2 ditches the confined-location cop thriller in favor of a meandering gangster saga punctuated by gore effects that would be grotesque if they weren't so tedious. It's like watching a film from an alternate-universe Michael Bay who actually understands how to stage and edit action, but is just as indifferent to coherent narrative.  I hated this movie, but there's no question that it does exactly what it sets out to do, even if I thought the most impressive thing about the whole movie was the Foley work.",0,"english"

"After a second viewing, I can safely say the Raid franchise is like the Godfather of action films. The plot is thickened in this film and the action is turned up to a new extreme. The fight scenes are so perfectly telegraphed and delivered, I've never seen anything like them on film before! While the first film was basically a framework for amazing fight scenes, this one adds depth and scope to an expanding world of crime in the Philippines.…",10,"english"
"The first half is way too plot driven for a fight flick like this. It was from the lack of plot in the original The Raid that gave the first one so much space for action packed fighting and less space for bullshit.  We can all agree that in most cases martial art actors have lackluster sensual acting abilities and charisma and for these Indonesian actors there's no exception.  I can understand how Evans wanted take a big step up…",7,"english"

To start with, I really thought it had dropped the ball. The 2 half hours seemed like it was way too much and it took a little while to get going. But when it does get going, it really doesn't stop.

"A few years ago, Welsh director Gareth Evans gave a kick to the gut of action cinema with The Raid: Redemption, an Indonesian brawler set entirely inside an apartment complex where a S.W.A.T. team had to navigate its way to the top level through a myriad of killers and thugs. Evans stripped it down to the bare essentials needed to create a cinematic narrative and put almost all of his creative juice into conceiving the most adrenalized, visceral and lightning-fast…",8,"english"
"The Raid 2 is easily one of the best, if not THE best, action films I have ever seen. It is brutal, intense, and rarely lets up.  The story is actually pretty interesting, and unlike the first film which takes place in one location over one day, this film spans a few years, and is more of a crime epic. Imagine the crazy intense action of the first film wrapped up in The Departed, with Kill Bill thrown in all…",10,"english"
"Doesn't have the nonstop action and bare bones plot that made the first one so good. It gets bogged down in a very standard story for most of its runtime (guy going undercover to avenge brother, greedy criminal provoking a gang war to move up). And it's frigin 2 and a half hours long. This shit aint Tropa de Elite, give me back my 99% violence 1% laconic dialogues please.  Also turns out Indonesians don't like white guys in flipflops drinking beer at their classy clubs. Racist bastards.",5,"english"

And if I saw this first, it probably would have crushed the aforementioned meter.  What this movie does offer, is a more ambitious story. There are…",9,"english"
"Dear God...  In retrospect the Raid 2 had quite a few scenes which weren't really needed in the main scheme of things and could probably stand to be half an hour shorter. But still...Jesus...

Thankfully, this was not the…",9,"english"
"I was a big fan of the original Raid and excited to see this film after hearing all the praise. I was also excited that Gareth Evans decided to do more of a traditional narrative instead of a sequel of another group of people trapped in one location (Speed 2, Die Hard 2 anyone?). The movie feels more like The Departed if Leo DiCaprio did more martial arts and beat up rooms full of thugs. The movie takes it's time…",8,"english"
"I am totally convinced without a single doubt in my mind that The Raid 2 is one of those rarest of movies that you MUST see without fail before you die!

"The first Raid is a film that i saw in the cinema, immediatelypre-ordered the BluRay and then watched every month thereafter, so I honestly didn't think it was possible for this sequel to be better than the first one but within 30 minutes I knew I was about to be proven wrong. The scope has widened dramatically and the plot has been meticulously crafted which is in stark contrast to the more basic premise of the first movie. Also I can't say I've ever seen fight scenes as tight as the ones here, just utterly mind blowing.",9,"english"
"Holy shitballs. Quite simply the greatest action movie of all time!  Great cinematography, an engaging plot, incredible camera work that puts you in the middle of the action, and let's you see everything clearly, and the greatest hand to hand combat ever committed to film.  It's a first watch, and 24 hours later that I'm writing this, but right now I'm calling it - flawless.",10,"english"

A good hour longer than the first instalment but the fight scenes are on another level, to the point of me being so tense I was pushed back in my seat without realising.

"John Peel once said about the band The Fall ""they're always different and always the same"". Two films into what looks set to become Gareth Evans' pet franchise, it's safe to say the same can be said of The Raid franchise. Installment 2 is longer, more story-driven, and more complex; but its primary pleasures remain those same ones that made its predecessor so appealing: the visceral, relentless and utterly impeccable fight scenes, the choreography almost unbelievable perfect, the bloodshed draw-a-breath shocking, the sequences building and building and building until you realise you haven't blinked in six minutes..",8,"english"
"The Raid 2 takes all the promise seen by Gareth Evans in that confined tower block, throws it out on a larger scale and proves that this guy is one hell of a talent.

"Nine Things about the Movie “The Raid 2: Berendal” (Indonesia, 2014)  1. In 2012, one of the greatest martial arts action movies ever made was released. It was called “The Raid: Redemption”.

If you have seen the first movie, you can pretty much stop reading the review right here and go see this one. Yes, it’s that…",10,"english"
"Picking up moments after the original, The Raid 2 expands extensively in scope and story by adding internal affairs like drama along with a more dramatic turn on the main character, Rama.  Rama this time goes undercover after his brother is killed by a rising crime lord. He deals with a lot of shit much like Billy Costigan from The Departed. I'll leave the story aspect of the movie there and focus on what the Raid series is known for…",9,"english"
"Second viewing was just as spectacular as the first. Just such a great film. I can't believe this movie was only made on $4 million...That's just insane. Gareth Evans is a spectacular director, and his action is just incredible. I feel like I could watch this on a loop all day...",10,"english"
"I love when sequels take place straight after the events of the first film and the opening scene of The Raid 2 is outstanding, which is the same level of greatness that continues throughout the whole film.  Martial arts are given a whole new edge of 'cool' taking a lot of inspiration for Kill Bill Vol 1 and alot of Grindhouse references too, clearly Gareth Evans is a huge Tarantino fan.  A lot better than the first, the storyline and dialogue has been given a lot of work and just visually it's brilliant.  Can't wait for the third one...",8,"english"
"2011's The Raid: Redemption was both a multiplex oddity and a major cinematic discovery. Despite his Welsh origins, writer-director Gareth Evans managed to make a kick-ass Indonesian martial arts movie that was all killer, no filler in the best way possible.

So I can understand the critic fan enthusiasm and yet again Mr Evans shows western cinema how to shoot action but man this is a lot harder film to enjoy.

"The Raid 2 certainly raises the bar for hyperkinetic action and the amount of what-the-fuck-how-did-they-do-that shots, but I feel that by taking away the clarity and straightforwardness of the first film, this sequel loses some of its predecessor's oomph. It's not convoluted or anything, but the film just doesn't live up to the crime saga ambitions that it aims for.

"The first Raid was like a video game. One badass climbing level after level to reach the final boss was pretty much the entire plot. There was a police corruption story in the background but it mainly served as a framing device for relentless well-choreographed action. The Raid 2 is boldly different. It picks up right where The Raid left off and immediately brings the corruption issue VERY much to the forefront, putting Rama - The Raid’s protagonist, who can’t…",9,"english"
"when they flip the talking to killing ratio boooooo",6,"english"
"More fights. More corrupt cops. More crime families. More goons. More “plot”. More gore. More fists to the face. More raid.",6,"english"
"Rama’s approach to undercover policing is nuanced and tactful. Kill everyone.",8,"english"
"This movie is very much more story driven than the first. I enjoyed that this movie takes place immediately after the first one ends and doesn’t let up on the brutality. Both of these movies will continue to be on my watch list and i pray Netflix is kind enough not to take them away from me.",9,"english"
"This and John wick 4 are the two best action films I’ve seen thus far in my life.",7,"english"

"It has a weak story and some pacing issues, but the rest is very well done",8,"english"
"more ambitious and risky and messy and i love it for that. the first 15 minutes of this thing really hum & deliver a fairly complicated setup very efficiently (yay nonlinear editing!) and then it's just another two hours & fifteen minutes of like, a scorsese movie with cartoon villains and so many insane fistfights. i love both RAID-children but this one doesn't take an hour to get to the fights & i feel like that's gotta give it a slight edge.  i…",10,"english"
"Greatest action movie? I think NOT",4,"english"
"At first, in taking a different approach than its relentless predecessor, this sequel's heavier focus on gangsters and undercover cops might seem like a detriment. Any fear of this is quickly removed, though, as action scenes still occur as frequently as they can, and their quality is equal to, if not superior to, the first film.  And given a more open setting than the first film's dingy apartment block, The Raid 2's fight scenes are able to stretch out --…",8,"english"
"Truly amazing action and camera work I haven't seen in many other movies. And Iko Uwais is sensational. I just hope he won't burn out like Tony Jaa.  But very few movies can hold up for 2,5 hours. And The Raid 2 isn't one of them.",6,"english"
"If you have ever liked an action movie...Watch The Raid 2. The only other reason not to watch the Raid 2 is apprehension that it will decrease the likelihood that you will ever enjoy another action movie as much. The Raid 1 was phenomenal, but 2 managed to grossly exceed expectations. Better action, and a much better story makes for my favorite action movie of all time. This is The Godfather 2 of the action genre.",10,"english"
"It’s quite simply one of the greatest stages for combat and action I have ever had the pleasure of seeing (at least when the story didn’t get in the way of all the fun). The choreography is spellbinding and flawless. Every fight was like an intimate exchange; a tango of death. Absolutely scintillating. Bulky story aside, I could have watched this film without a single word of dialogue.  They really need to stop making that shit look so easy and fun.  *I haven’t seen Part 1",7,"english"
"It's like if there was an ultra serious two and a half hour Step-Up movie about the complicated goal of saving the rec center.  Or...  Press A for limb break Press B for face wall/floor smash cue agonizing 20 minute cut scene  I'm sorry but the drama here fell so flat for me. Even more disappointing is that I felt numb towards the majority of the action. Incredibly repetitive action beats made it feel like I watching someone button mash.…",4,"english"
"This was a lot of fun as expected. The fight scenes are insane and brutal. So many times during the fight scenes it would just put a big smile on my face or make me wince and say ""damn!"". Hammer Girl and Baseball Bat guy were obvious favorites. I loved any time they were on screen. The only thing that was a tad disappointing was the story. Just for the fact that ive seen the exact same plot played out…",8,"english"
"The Raid 2 is the sequel to (you guessed it) The Raid; both are fantastic martial arts thriller but with a bigger budget The Raid 2 improves on both the technically aspects and the scope of the film though it falters with a convoluted script especially compared to the bare-bones script of the first film. The cinematography and choreography are top notch, very visceral and brutal; you cringe with the pain of the characters. Though the script is a bit…",8,"english"
"The raid movies bring so much unfiltered grit it’s incredible. The final fight scene is easily one of the best fight scenes I’ve ever witnessed . Movie did not have to be that damn long but the payoff so insane. Also, “silent badass assassin defined by 2 or 3 key off the wall character traits” enjoyers, we are eatin goooooood",9,"english"
"Alright! Had seen the first wan a while ago, a fantastic low budget action film. This is not just the same but more, it's quite a different movie. We go from an ""Assault on Precinct 13 but with actually good action"" type film to an attempt at ""The Departed but with martial arts"".  Now, to be clear, this script is not that great. It's not bad by any means, it's functional in setting up conflicts to be resolved by kicking…",0,"english"

"Still amazing. The final fight scene is just as good even after rewatching it on YT every couple of months.",10,"english"
"The Raid 1 is like when you order a plain cheeseburger and you get like the PERFECT plain cheeseburger.   The Raid 2 is when you order a hefty big burger with lettuce, and bacon and double meat and ect. Like its MORE of what i enjoy… but did those pickles REALLY need to be there?   My point is that this film unlike the first one really wants to have a story. Only problem is that the story is predictable and…",8,"english"
"A fantastic sequel. It goes bigger in scale and bolder with the fights, but doesn’t loose what made the first special. It still has the insane fight choreography and amazing direction, but the storyline is more complex. It slows down and allows us to understand who these characters truly are, and I love that decision.",9,"english"
"I watched The Raid years ago, so I’ll be honest - Plot-wise, I had no idea what was going on, and the motivations of all the characters were totally lost on me. At least, in terms of their connection to the first film in the series.  That being said, the choreography was insane. Like the first movie, the fight scenes showcase the Indonesian fighting style of Pencak Silat. It’s brutal, and completely unrelenting. The cinematography of all the fight scenes alone was enough for my enjoyment.  Shit was wild to say the least.",7,"english"
"An Action Masterpiece.   The sheer creativity on display here when it comes to fight choreography, camerawork and editing is mindblowing. Of course I also absolutely adored the NIN needledrop at the end.  The story is surprisingly good too.  The only reason why I haven‘t given The Raid 2 the perfect score is that I have one major gripe with the film and it‘s the color grading.  I just think the film looks weirdly pale (almost like they just used the raw footage) and that really bothered me since almost every other department is firing on all cylinders.  9-10/10",9,"english"
"This movie made me think about how painful it would be to get kicked in the ribs.",9,"english"
"Just incredible action filmmaking. The cinematography is actually insane at times. There are scenes where the camera moves in seemingly impossible ways.",9,"english"
"Less successful than The Raid: Redemption, this is still an incredibly gripping and exciting action film, with brutal and tense action sequences that never fail to amaze in their technical prowess on both a filmmaking level and a performance level. It’s more sprawling narrative is ambitious and impressive mostly, but on the whole it spreads the action out a little bit too much. However, it’s hard to complain when the action is this mind blowing",8,"english"
"impressions from my 7th-or-so watch of The Raid 2:  • the photography is too low-contrast, and really overstates its greys • these characters aren't as interesting as Gareth Evans wants them to be • the central plot kinda loses its protagonist somewhere in act 2  none of this matters. a GOAT among action flicks, one of the best kick-punchers to ever do it.",10,"english"
"The fight sequences are, unsurprisingly, some of the best I’ve ever seen. But they really played up the emotional storyline in this one, to the extent that the runtime ended up feeling bloated. Still one of the best martial arts movies.",7,"english"
"~10 of the best action scenes ever",8,"english"
"Far superior to its predecessor. I wonder just how many injuries were sustained during its production, the choreography was completely mental. Great film. Wow.",8,"english"
"Apart from the fight scenes, this movie has nothing rooting for it. Absolutely trash acting",6,"english"
"Are we sure John Wick could survive an hour in this world? Raid 2 doubles down on both fight scenes and plot, culminating in a long convoluted runtime, but the action set pieces, choreography, and camera techniques keep you gripped. So many 1-on-50 fight scenes, you’d think The Bride and Oh-Dae-Su had it easy.",9,"english"
"What a wild, wild ride. Not as good as the first but a sold sequel. It’s a little too long. There was no need for mad dog to be in this movie and could have cut the run time down at least 20 minutes. What made the first a perfect movie was the isolated set piece with concentrated characters. This one was a little scattered in plot and pacing. However, ending was exactly what the original Raid gave with some stellar fight scenes and choreography. I could watch that fight scene in the kitchen 10 times in a row. Great job.",8,"english"
"i definitely enjoyed the story of this one more, but it’s a bit too long and slow in some parts. some absolutely amazing fight scenes, some cool executions, and that title card went hard. they could’ve cut out 20 minutes and had the same story, but if you’re willing to push through a couple boring scenes you’re in for an amazing treat if you wanna see some gory, awesome fights",8,"english"
"Holy shit. I have never seen such consistently good action in a movie. Let alone one with a 4 million dollar budget. This is how you maximize your budget. Sure it looks cheap in some parts but the action scenes all look phenomenal in some way. The shot composition and lighting are so much better than the first film as well. I was not expecting to be so hooked into the story, but I was by the end of it.…",10,"english"
"The Raid: Redemption is an action movie that throws you right into a simple, yet engaging adventure, with tons of tension and creative choreography.  The Raid 2 is an action movie that throws you right into dialogue with a thousand characters that are never properly introduced or developed (with some great action).  I feel like this movie really wants to be a character-driven action epic, yet the plot is very standard and the characters are never utilized. It’s a shame…",5,"english"
"Pretty good looking movie with a really dull story. I wouldn’t say I loved the presentation but it was great all around and the action choreography is still up with the original. In general, I’d also say it is a better looking movie than the original too.  But after the first act I was totally disinterested in everything that was going on, only looking up to watch the action scenes which were fun but otherwise lacked any stakes due to…",5,"english"
"Never watch the dub 😂",10,"english"
"A little too much plot for me for this kind of movie but the action as well noted is great, really impressive scenes and it was fun and ridiculous action which is what I was looking for.",7,"english"
"With simmering tension and explosive hyperviolence, The Raid 2 picks up where its predecessor left off, albeit with a greater focus on narrative. In all, this plot-focused installment still provides so many brilliant moments of action, but I can still recognise how much of the magic of the first film stems from its 'Bottle Episode'-like feel. Iko Uwais is once again a brilliant leading man, capable of both incredible feats of athleticism and also able to carry the story of…",8,"english"
"No, part 2 was definitely the better movie with much more sophisticated plot and mis-en-sen and cinematography. Right fr the opening scene in the feild ala Scorsese, to claustrophobic fight in the 4×6 jail cell and the awesome train battle, this one was superior to the first. Besides, we got to see the corrupt cop Reza in this one (could've picked a better looking guy, just sayig).",7,"english"
"Somebody call Paul McCartney! They just took Maxwells silver hammer to a whole new level!",7,"english"
"I’m surprised this has a higher average rating than the first film. It’s not as good. It’s still brilliant, with some utterly jaw dropping sequences….. it’s just really long, and the story didn’t need 2.5 hours.   To be fair the time for the most part flew by, but some sequences, like the car chase, felt out of place and I don’t think the film would have suffered for losing them.  Great ending though! Shame there isn’t a third…. Yet!",8,"english"
"There is simply no one more unstoppable than Rama.",10,"english"
"I liked this one a bit more than the first one. Altough the first one has a lot more action scenes and I liked it's short runtime this one has the more interesting and better written story which I liked a lot. The ending was great.  I again loved the action scenes here too ofc.",8,"english"
"So many faces hitting edges of stuff.",10,"english"
"It’s feels very long but somehow keeps getting better as it goes on, with too many stellar action scenes to recount all at once, like an unwieldy double album absolutely packed with bangers. I need a lie down now.",0,"english"
"The Departed meets John Wick  I never knew hammers could cause such devastation on the human body   motorcycle helmets can save you from crashing but not from 30 mini-Uzi rounds to the face  about 90 different objects are used for murder in this movie including 10 from car parts alone  baseball bat guy and hammer girl need a spin-off    If there is a 3rd Raid that comes out I am watching it in 4D IMAX   The girl “singing” karaoke made this a 5 star",10,"english"
"The Raid 1 and 2 boasts some of the greatest fight sequences ever put on screen.  The choreography is executed so well and the fights are long winded, brutal and so dam enjoyable.  The reason this is a step down from the first, is because I liked the tighter and smaller nature of the first one as it is set in just one building.  Whilst this was in a lot of different locations, I still absolutely loved it.  84/100",8,"english"
"I let Taylor borrow Hara Kiri forever ago and I knew it would take him forever to watch so I borrowed his copy of The Raid 2 as ransom. But then Netflix gave me the big fuck you and started streaming it. Luckily Taylor got to it a few nights ago, so now we negotiate the hostages.   It’s not as contained as the first, literally and figuratively, and it’s a little longer than needed, but it still manages to up…",8,"english"
"More gruesome than the already violent first movie. The movie just makes me wish I watched more Asian action films in general. The cinematography and direction really stepped up in this adrenaline-fuelled sequel. On Prime Video, we rented it, only to find it dubbed in English ONLY. Glad we were able to find it elsewhere in Indonesian because the acting is so good. Although it is great, it is not as good as the first one for me. Mostly because…",9,"english"
"I am at a complete loss as to what I have just watched. James Cameron is shaking in his boots over his place as the director of the best action film of all time.  Simply put, I have never known action like it. It has the best car chase I've ever seen and quite possibly the best fight scene I have ever seen. It did all the action as well as the first, if not better, but combined it with…",10,"english"
"What an unbelievable pair of films. I've had the first at a 10 and said it's one of the best action films I've ever seen where it's all action and the action is unmatched. This film takes a relatively slower approach, opting to take time to develop a plot; something the first film didn't do but I didn't care. While I think that is the weakest element of this film, the action in the rest of it continues to be…",10,"english"
"Christ on a bike. How a film this long manages to just keep motoring and keep delivering back-to-back all-time great set pieces is just astonishing. It has a fairly bare-bones plot and a goofy looking villain, but I'm going to break my normally-strict policy and give full marks anyway, because everything is just unbelievable. The camera knows exactly when to cut, and when to hold on mind-boggling choreography. The soundtrack knows exactly when it's needed, and when to back out…",10,"english"
"I much preferred the simpler aspect of the first Raid, of course with this being a sequel it makes sense that they'd want to go bigger and go bigger they do. The phenomenal fight choreography is still here though only with it being way more brutal this time around which is a very good thing.  Also that kitchen fight scene... *chefs kiss*",8,"english"
"the Iko v. Cecep fight remains the best choreographed scene in all of cinema and that’s borderline inarguable. this is the standard and the only other film that comes close is The Night Comes For Us. Iko Uwais is so unstoppable, he deserves even more global popularity than he already has, he deserves to be a household name",10,"english"
"after watching both the first movie and this one, I am appalled at how jj abrams could’ve possibly wasted these guys in star wars on a dumb joke.",8,"english"
"A constant chaotic bloodbath that had me grinning from the intro to the credits",10,"english"
"I always commended The Raid for its utter disregard for having a plot, and I sincerely believed it didn't need one. I still don't think it does. But it turns out it's even better with one. Evans and leading man Iko Uwais take the bone-crunching action of the first movie and blend it up with the gangland melodrama of The Godfather or Infernal Affairs, picking up less than half-an-hour after the first movie but expanding the story out over several years. And the action is, if anything, even better than before.",10,"english"
"89/100  Gareth Evans truly found the perfect rhythm for an action film; 15 minutes of talking followed by one of the greatest action scenes ever made, and repeat for 150 minutes or so. The story is completely serviceable here; the only thing that matters is that Rama put a lot on the line for his fucking job, and to accomplish it he's ready to beautifully kick some ass. Perfect may not be the exact term here though, since there are…",9,"english"
"I much preferred the original's general directness and simpler story. Sometimes more is not always better and that’s what this one feels like. The plot was bloated as hell and half of the time, I had no idea who was fighting whom or for what reason. The two hammers as a weapon were cool as hell though.",4,"english"
"An impressive and incredibly entertaining movie that serves as a bad sequel. The first movie has a brilliant premise set in one location with a small budget and is pretty short on the run time. This sequel is long as hell, goes many places around a city and even a jail, features tons of characters, skips around time, and has car chases even! It obviously offers more variety in the action department and story department but lacks consistency and alienates…",5,"english"
"The Raid 2 operates on a different scope than its predecessor. Yet it's all the better for it! Relentless action ramps up the stakes and ferocious combat. A compelling story makes the quieter scenes interesting to watch for a change. Helps that they effectively build up to the big moments. The cast gives genuinely solid performances, with each player getting their time to shine. Gareth Evans's more ambitious direction and willingness to add variety to the action ensures this is…",8,"english"
"If The Raid (2011) is an appetizer, then Raid 2 is the main course, dessert, and comped drinks. It’s just one scene after another of mind-bending fight choreography. The first is restricted to the apartment complex, so I was glad to see this one really open up the world building and offer a variety of action set pieces to gush over. A perfect action movie.",10,"english"

"The best shot and skilled fight choreography I've seen put in a movie. The pulpy plot and characters aren't nearly as strong and it could probably lose 10 minutes, but there's enough in the styling, aesthetics, and some of how not everything is laid out and explained to us that keeps those aspects from being too big a black eye. All the plotting can start to fray if you ask too many questions (Uco...what exactly is his end goal and…",9,"english"
"I can’t tell which of the Raid films I like more. This one feels more like a action crime drama epic where as they first one is much more of a straight up action thriller. This is definitely an example of how to nail a sequel, take elements of the first film and improve on them while telling a different story.",10,"english"
"The Raid 2 is proof that action movies can still be gorgeous works of art, and can be aesthetically pleasing without feeling synthetic, nor forced, and at the very least, without feeling visually sanctioned by company.  after all, gray and white are colours, too... there're just very specific ways to use them to stand out/feel vibrant, and this film absolutely makes those choices worth the 2 & 1/2 hour runtime.  it has a lot more story than the first film, sure,…",9,"english"
"Watching this on the train, trying not to squeal in delight during every fight scene and disturb the other passengers. Its been very hard.",9,"english"
"THE BAR HAS BEEN RAISED!!! They managed to take everything great about the first Raid film and elevated it to even greater heights. The open world setting really allowed the filmmakers to be creative with their action set pieces and visuals. This movie should definitely be regarded as a pillar for the action genre.",10,"english"
"Greatest Action Movie of all time.",10,"english"
"Gareth Evans really overestimated how much I was invested into the story of the first Raid movie",7,"english"
"This feels similar to what the Godfather Part II is as a follow-up to its original. Whereas the first Raid excelled due to its simple premise and awesome execution, this sequel feels too overstuffed with new characters we don’t care about talking to each other instead of the focus on Rama and action scenes we were expecting. That said the fight scenes are SICK (somehow better than the first film) and when it finally kicks off in the last hour…",8,"english"
"An improvement above the first in every way. This was great and the plot had my attention from the very beginning. A little too long tho.",7,"english"
"Kick! Punch! It's all in the mind. Plot! Drama! It’s all in the rewind.",9,"english"
"I hope to show this to my children one day. ""Son, this is what a man does"" I will say. Better than the first. I appreciated how the filmmakers asked themselves ""what if he beat up a bunch of guys in a bunch of different places instead of just one place?"" Gareth Evans should have to just pay Iko Uwais a 25% retainer fee for every dollar he made after they did those first three films together.",8,"english"
"When watching the second version of the all-new Indonesian The Raid, the concept is kind of ruined. (My review of The Raid ) Instead of the original Indo feel, it feels westernized, probably by its popularity. Even with a baffling story (that I mostly never paid attention to because I was too sleepy), it felt, a little of the same.  The long and still action-packed movie never really gets to a climax, because there is so much violence in the…",7,"english"
"Yes!!! The fact that this movie is two and a half hours was initially slightly worrying because the simple brutality is what I adored about the original, but I think they managed to pull it off. It took me awhile to get into the more complex crime story this film was telling but once I did there was no turning back. Somehow each fight scene felt unique and memorable in its execution and the third act feels genuinely harrowing. I’m…",9,"english"
"Actually I need to say one thing bad about the movie, no spoiler tag because it’s the first scene.   It was a fucking awful decision to kill andi in the FIRST FUCKING SCENE. He’s the best side character other than mad dog in the first movie and he’s better than anyone in this movie. At least keep him till the second act or something holy fuck.",8,"english"
"Needed more pegging",8,"english"
"Damn. I think this movie (and the first one) ruined action movies for me. How creative they were with the actioned boggled my mind. Compared to the first one this one is more grand. It really benefitted from having a much higher budget (still a low budget). I really can't say enough about how insane the action is. And it doesn't pull any punches. Everyone needs to watch this.",10,"english"

"You put Rama in a cage with The Punisher, Khabib, Jackie Chan, and a couple gorillas and I promise you the rest of them are gonna have about 3 limbs left by the time he's done with them. Iko Uwais is HIM!!!",8,"english"
"Writing this upon freshly finishing this roller coaster of an action flick. All I can say is wow, this was one hell of a fun movie, though certainly not for the faint of heart. Breakneck action (literally) at a solid pace with far more exposition than the original. Please, do yourself a favor and watch The Raid series.",7,"english"
"No movie has a greater disparity in the quality of filmmaking between the action scenes and literally every other scene.",7,"english"
"My toxic trait is thinking that I could also make fight scenes look so good that it almost masks a plot I really could care less for  With that said though, shit; at this point, I don't even need that Sleeping Dogs video game adaptation, this'll do nicely.",8,"english"
"Some of the most insane fight choreography I have ever seen. Soooo good",8,"english"
"Life is full of simple pleasures - one of them is kicking back and watching Iko Uwais pulverise bad guys for two and a half hours… I could go on and explain how the script adeptly weaves you into the fabric of a corrupt and dangerous underworld while fleshing out its wide array of players, but I’d rather just say once again - and not for the last time - that Gareth Evans is the best action director currently working in the film industry. The Raid 2 not only raised the bar - it pretty much humiliates anything that dares imitate it. 10/10.",10,"english"
"This expertly made Indonesian action thriller takes the brutal fight action from the first film, cranks it up even more, and adds an engaging and well written crime narrative at its core. The action is visceral, well choreographed and a treat to see it masterfully executed.",10,"english"
"my wife wanted to rewatch this tonight, so you might say things are still *really* working out between us",0,"english"
"Epic. I love both these films. Would like to watch both of these back to back one day.",9,"english"

"I have no idea what I was smoking when I first saw this in 2014 and my 4.5/5 rating because fuck man this is like the greatest movie ever made.",10,"english"
"Put Iko Uwais in the action movie hall of fame, he is one of the best to ever do it.  You will see no better fight scenes than you will in this movie. I just love the pacing of the fights. The actors moves are lightning quick but are timed so well that the audience can follow every punch and kick. Every blow is strong and deliberate but they never feel choreographed or fake. A masterful performance from all involved.  If only it wasn’t an unnecessary two and a half hours it’d be right there with its predecessor.",9,"english"
"Would you like to see fights take place in prisons? in clubs? in subway trains? in cars? in restaurants? in bars? in kitchens? This movie has it all. No raids though. Still awesome. Hammer Girl is the best.",10,"english"
"Love Iko Uwais making the time to throw soup into someone's face at that post-car confrontation restaurant fight. Gotta make time for that in between breaking limbs and stabbing jugulars.",8,"english"
"The Raid and the Raid 2 are equally amazing. The action is super hot as one would expect and the expanding world and story is done simply and effectively. At around 2½ hours it flies by, I could definitely watch again!",8,"english"
"Hadn’t seen this since it came out so this was a nice revisit.   First of all, the action sequences and set pieces are every bit as amazing as the first film, and perhaps even more brutal. Certainly they, and the film itself are filmed in a much more eye-catching manner, with much improved cinematography and creative camera work. The movie just looks leaps and bounds better than the first.  Sadly, where it falls down is the story. The first film…",7,"english"
"A bloated, occasionally wayward sequel that shares the same recommendation from me that I give The Matrix Reloaded: if you stick with it, there is an insanely rewarding freeway setpiece in the back half.  If you want more of the bloody and relentless action sequences that made the first Raid so exciting, you'll find it here - a lot of the setpieces even surpass its predecessor in sheer, ""OH SHIT"" quality of meticulously staged violence. The last twenty minutes or so are jaw-dropping.",8,"english"
"A worthy and ambitious sequel that ups the ante on violence, turning every fight scene into a brutal bloodbath. Evans gets more inventive with his camerawork and choreography which is spectacular to watch as well. It’s definitely more plot focused than its predecessor but it doesn’t always pay off with some sections dragging on a little bit, I think overall it could have been a bit shorter. That being said it’s still a thoroughly entertaining and gripping thrill ride.",8,"english"
"I liked the punching.",0,"english"
"Ok. Not to be predictable… but for better or for worse, this is the best action film I’ll likely ever see. Everything was absolutely spot on, and for what it is, I can only say it’s absolute perfection, with fear of repeating myself.   Not once was I left bored or dissatisfied, and everything I said of the first film is applicable to this one and more.  This, ladies and gentlemen, is how you do a motherfucking action film. I’m still in awe.",0,"english"
"I watched this straight after part one and I’m surprised my heart survived the afternoon! Another serving of fantastically choreographed violence, some of which made my eyes water. The sequel was more plot and character driven than the first which was fine, I’m glad it wasn’t made complicated and nonsensical which is a trap other action films fall into. Most importantly these new story elements were not introduced at the expense of the action.",8,"english"

"The extended, theatrical, hyper-stylistic fight sequences don't always quite gell with the layered, Scorseseian, overlong gangster epic the director is trying for but it still doesn't feel nearly as long as it's runtime. The meat of the story and the action scenes are well told & well shot & well acted even if they don't match up in the flow of the thing. Plus the kitchen fight is one of the finest pieces of action choreography ever put to film.",8,"english"

"I firmly believe The Raid 2 is…  A: One of the greatest action films.  B: One of the most beautifully shot action films.  C: One of the most underrated action films.  D: A movie that everyone should see.  E: Gareth Evans deserves a lot of praise for this movie as well as the first Raid movie.  F: The prison riot scene is one of the greatest fight scenes ever made.  G: Amazing sound design.",10,"english"
"A truly spectacular conclusion to the action-packed and spotless The Raid (2011).  As an enormous fan of ultra-violence and fluid fights in cinema, I comfortably claim that this second outing with Gareth Evans breaks unseen boundaries in direction, cinematography, and choreography in not only martial arts movies, but the action genre as a whole, perhaps to a greater extent than the glorious Mad Max: Fury Road.  Punching and kicking is generally a form of combat represented in action as dull…",9,"english"
"Still too long. Still amazing action. Still better than the first film.",8,"english"
"Can an action film sustain a 150 minute running time? Conventional wisdom would tell you not - but the Raid 2 takes that wisdom and roundhouse kicks it out of the window.  This one starts a bit slower but then starts to build speed as it powers from breathtaking set piece to breathtaking set piece. Any one of these confrontations would grace the end of a normal action film but here they just pile in one after another, each one…",10,"english"
"Unfortunately, this film does not hold up as a sequel to the raid.  The raid is a 2 hour insane action film that's nonstop and exhilarating.  The raid 2 has the same quality of action, in fact, in certain areas its a whole new level. However unlike the first raid, this film is deeply tied back by its narrative.",8,"english"

"Surviving Edged Weapons II: Indonesian Boogaloo  Doubles down on the gratuitous violence of The Raid, so many scenes of mind-numbing bodily harm, it's enough to make your eyes roll back. Squibs, arm breaks, and knife wounds galore. Maybe it's just because I started it late at night, but at 150 minutes it definitely begins to feel its length, the action scenes are well spaced throughout its runtime but still, there's only so much I can take in during one sitting.…",8,"english"

Not quite as awesome as the first, but those last 30 minutes man, hot damn they’re amazing. Once again I can’t really find fault with any of the writing, it flows really well. Those action sequences throughout though, they give me life with just how perfectly shot and choreographed they are. Never…",10,"english"
"The Raid 2 is the Godfather of martial arts movies, and I mean that in the most literal sense possible. Everything you'd expect from a classic mob movie is here, only through the lens of the sort of ultra-violent martial arts flicks such as the first Raid. There's a scene where a bunch of people are whacked, there are dinners, there's betrayal, it's got everything. I don't know if I liked it quite as much as the first Raid, but it's close enough that I consider both five-star experiences. That fight scene in the restaurant kitchen at the end was fucking bonkers.",10,"english"
"No offense but if you like this one better you are dumb.",6,"english"
"While the fight choreography is still incredible, just about every other aspect is a step down from the first film. While the original The Raid was a tight 100 minutes of action with just enough plot to keep it moving, the sequel bloats to two and a half hours with a trite gangster plotline that added little value. The fights, while spectacularly executed, don't feel like are serving any purpose besides being adjacent to the plot as it chugs along.…",7,"english"

"I’m happy to say this measures up to the first film. It trades the taut rollercoaster for a more developed narrative which is actually easier to follow. That’s probably because it’s one long Red Harvest trope but it’s whatever. Some of the sound effects were cartoonish, especially in that prison yard mud fight. However, we still get the utter insanity of one man vs an army which feels reminiscent of a zombie film due to the sheer scale of the threat.",9,"english"

"The Raid 2's masterful study of the craft known as action is breathtaking and eye-popping as Gareth Evans concocted a thrill ride that gives more than what it wanted to get. From pacing to editing, The Raid 2 is just not a typical action movie, it's THE action movie that everyone seeks to make. What made this film fantastic is its ameliorated characters and focus on its story. The Raid 2 will leave you speachless no matter what genre you like. It's a recluse that changes the whole action genre entirely.",9,"english"
"Absolutely one of the greatest action films of all time with pure, unbelievable talent displayed both in front of and behind the camera. There’s never been better fight choreography than this in any film and I don’t think anything beats Hammer Girl’s and Baseball Bat Boy’s introductions. Visceral cinema at its best",10,"english"
"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  I’ve been trying to get through this film for around four years but never got past the half way mark. I had problems with the world building and relatively slower pace. But it’s a rewarding experience to sit through it. Raid 2 is a epic action film which is bigger in every way than its predecessor. Gareth Evans is very ambitious with the filming style and the fights are amazing. The car chase was my favorite. The moment where the…",9,"english"

"""...I'm done.""  The Raid 2 is a good sequel, but it's a very, very different film from the first movie. There's a lot more story here for starters, but it's 50 minutes longer than the first one, so there's more of everything. It's not as unique, but I appreciate that it's not a retread of the first film in any way. This time, the story drives the film rather than the action. The fighting is great again, and it's bloodier,…",7,"english"
"I want to like it more. I gave it a high score regardless.  The raid isn't until the last twenty minutes or so.  As an undercover cop film, it simply underutilized the main character. This should have been a 10/10. And I'm mad it wasn't. There's simple story telling issues that shouldn't exist.  There's better expressions of the genre.  Also, after The Raid, this is a complete mismatch of expectations. However, that doesn't make this a bad film in any regard. Just an annoyance of filmmaking. That factor did not impact my score.",8,"english"
"While I definitely enjoyed the first Raid movie in a lot of respects, there was no doubt in my mind that it focused on the action to the point where literally every other aspect of it suffered as a result, making for an extremely fun, yet flawed movie. The Raid 2 manages to fix a lot of this, not only further improving upon the already insane action choreography, but putting a much greater sense of polish in all the right…",9,"english"

"Asian Cinema Challenge 2021  Like its predecessor, The Raid 2 has some of the most impeccable, impactful action. The fight choreography is raw and quick complemented by fluid camerawork that captures everything with precision. The action may be incredible, but the film that surrounds the physicality is underwhelming. For one, the music is forgettable and bland. It often feels like an amalgamation of every Hollywood film score picked into one. It never feels completely attached to the film’s content. Moreover,…",6,"english"
"Some of the best fight choreography ever put to film. The Raid 2 is just as visceral and intense as the first one, but expanded with more locations, more story and more runtime. Instead of following up the pressure cooker setting of the building raid from the first film with more of the same, the sequel instead goes into a crime thriller story. I have such a blast with this film and honestly if the antagonist had more to do towards the climax I'd consider this a near perfect crime action film.",9,"english"

"It takes the action of the first film and places it in a large scale gangster movie which makes it the best action movie and the best gangster movie in a long time.

"The Raid 2 is very good followup to its fantastic predecessor. It is quiet rare to see sequels to action films match the quality of the first installment these days. Or even just be good.

"Not 2.5 hours of wall-to-wall action would be fine... if the bulk of it wasn't braindead sledgehammer melodrama. There's no value in any of the time H-tier Arrogant Crimelordson is up on screen and yet it's as much his movie as it is Raid Guy's.  Far, far too much genuinely attempted pathos for me to credit this as some kind of ironically dramatic meatgrinder. What a disappointment.",4,"english"
"From a cinematography standpoint the film looks fantastic. Great use of colours from red to blue to green. Nice bits of subtle yet cinematic lighting.  The action scenes are shot really well and choreographed spectacularly.   The story and feel of the film is very cold. No moment of levity both with the script and filmmaking. It’s very serious. A little too serious, I actually laughed a few times at how crazy things got but it maintains a serious approach from the characters and tone.   - 3•8/5",7,"english"
"Guns, knives, shivs, machetes, hammers, bats (and, ridiculously, baseballs), and every part of the human body that can be used as a weapon. The Raid 2 has it all, short of going medieval.  Writer-director-editor Gareth Evans' sequel is an exercise in endurance and a gang-war of attrition that I actually liked better than the first Raid, despite the increased run time. Much like Atomic Blonde, the story doesn't really matter. The action is the star and there is one high-impact…",9,"english"
"John Wick who? (All jokes I love John Wick). But in all seriousness, I didn’t think they could get any bigger or action packed than the first Raid, yet here we are. They did. My only complaint would be the pacing. It’s not quite as compact as the first film. There’s a lot of down time in between the action scenes. Down time that isn’t always the most interesting. Other than that, The Raid 2 is a huge action spectacle with some absolutely insane stunt work.",9,"english"
"One of the only sequels that I can think of that isn't hindered by some slavic devotion to its original. There is almost a Godfather II-esque sense of world expansion, morality, and betrayal, as it goes places that the first film didn't bother with. It may be too long and not as much of an instant shot of adrenaline as The Raid (nor as tight of a narrative), but when it's on point, it is downright merciless in its goal of matching its predecessor in the swiftness, precision, shock, and inventiveness of its action sequences.",9,"english"
"I actually surprisingly don't love this one as much as I used to- don't get me wrong, it's got some of the fucking craziest action I've ever seen, but at 2.5 hours it starts to get a bit punishing to get through. Maybe I'm just tuning out a bit cause with watching the first one right before this I'm going on hour 4 of subtitles & ultra violence lol. However it does do much more interesting things with it's seedy underworld plot than the first, so the long runtime isn't entirely unwarranted by any means.",9,"english"

Very exhausting for the viewer, but so much fun. The stunts and the camerawork is incredible.",8,"english"
"Better than the first one . On top of the top tier action and choreography , the script is more complex with charactera that are given depth and dimension and a complicated plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat .

Sure, some might not appreciate the drama, but damn it if I wasn’t heavily invested. And the action is gorgeously choreographed! I’d appreciate a little less of the shakey cam, but I’ll live with it.

"It's bloated, it's about 30-60 minutes longer than it really has any right to be, its plot is absolute nonsense and trades the original's simplicity for an attempt at a over-written and over-complicated crime drama...  ...But GOOD. GOD. The climax is like a shot of the strongest cinematic adrenaline known to man. Some of the best fight sequences ever put to film are in this film's final 30 minutes and very nearly make the film's bloated length entirely worth it.…",9,"english"
"This was unbelievably dope. There were a couple scenes where I was confused about what was actually going on, but that’s probably more my fault than the movies.

"I mentioned in my reviews of the Police Story movies that Jackie Chan's stunt team will forever be unrivaled. I stand by that. But the team on this movie has given them fierce fucking competition.  The Raid 2 crams so much visual nuance into its action scenes that it's practically art. Eye-popping carnage to intensely visceral effect- I always feel physically exhausted after this movie. The barrier between reality and the movie only cushions the blows- but on some level,…",8,"english"
"guess what, this is my favorite action movie EVER",10,"english"
"The only thing stopping this from being better than the original was not deciding to make this half an hour shorter. I liked this one getting a story but straight up some of these non-action scenes were ungodly long for little reason.  As is, the first is the best, and if two of these are all we get, I'm satisfied because the worst of these is still 4 stars at least. Action King Iko Uwais",8,"english"

"Doesn't quite have that knack of simplicity that we got to see from the first film, but where The Raid 2 delivers is in the expansion of Rama's character in a slightly larger setting. It feels like the Arkham City to the Arkham Asylum. Same characters and features of that one contained story, with a slightly larger scope, and the usual fast paced brilliantly put together choreography.  The length is barely noticeable unless you're looking at your clock, with a…",8,"english"
"Upping the ante The Raid promotes itself from straight forward action movie Die Hard territory to crime storytelling of The Departed territory with an extra punch. This time taking more of a slow burn approach, building the tension untill it finally explodes, The Raid 2 is one of the greatest crime and martial art action movies ever made. Between the amazing fight scenes and masterfully written story Gareth Evans has created a modern masterpiece with this movie.",10,"english"

That’s great sentence because it’s true, and continues my ongoing mentioning Andrew in my Letterboxd reviews bit.

"Holy shit. Easily as good as the first. In some ways, better. The bigger world certainly helped, which is weird considering the first was so good because it was in a small space and the action just kept coming...  Never been one for huge amounts of gory violence but this turns it up to 11 from the first, but in The Raid and The Raid 2, the violence just fits and isn't overly gratuitous, and is edited really well. Its graphic, but it just works.  Also, please reboot The Matrix with Iko Uwais as Neo. And make it dark as fuck.",9,"english"

"ON THE RAID AGAIN  Gareth Evans THE RAID world opens up in this sequel that ends up way too long with too many subplots that suck suspense and tension out of the story. That said this movie is even better on a technical level than its predecessor. Great camera work, brutal and stylish fight sequences, good directing. With a more focused script this could've been better than the contained first film. Instead the world is bigger, the movie longer, the overall impact lesser.  That said it's still a good looking, exciting action movie.",7,"english"

"Quick thoughts:  For anyone whose biggest cinematic blindspot is foreign films, I'd argue that the Raid franchise is the perfect gateway drug. The first Raid is a basic, yet ultra violent action crime thriller that takes place primarily within an apartment complex, while The Raid 2 takes everything that was good about the original and turns it up to eleven. The budget increased at least 3 fold, the world expanded, the cinematography improved quite drastically, and the fight scenes became…",10,"english"
"A big epic crime, action movie. A+ action scenes and surprisingly good cinematography. The movie can drag in bits and the movie loses its thread half way through it, where a character reminds or MC why he's where he is and said to myself ""Oh, yeah. I totally forgot"". The movie seemed to forget why or MC was where he was, and so did I. Better and more ambitious than the first one. If they would have kept the story…",8,"english"
"The Raid was one of the most focused, energetic, kinetic and brutal action films I’ve seen in years, it was relentless in its breakneck pace, it was a trim and slim 100 minutes and had such incredible momentum.

"I have said it before, and I will say it again: The Raid 2 is a martial arts masterpiece that revolutionizes the genre from the days of Bruce Lee to Jackie Chan to Donnie Yen. Iko Uwais is phenomenal in this film, and it amazes me that Hollywood has not tried to make him an action star in America yet (his cameo in Star Wars: The Force Awakens does NOT count).  The way this film shows the action from several unique…",10,"english"
"The action in this movie is levels above every other movie. The final two fight scenes are so intense and well choreographed. I have watched those two scenes countless times.

"Turning the simple premise of a film like The Raid into a more complex sequel leaves me torn. Not that I don’t want to see what the Raid universe looks like outside of that one tall building, but the minimalism of the original was part of what emphasized the tone.

"After watching The Raid 1 and 2 for the third time, I can say that The Raid 2 is a huge step up from it's predecessor! Bigger Budget film, which means twice the brutality, better cinematography, a bigger and badder story line, and much more unique action scenes! The one thing I guess I can say that I really like about Raid: Redemption compared to Raid 2, is the simplicity, and the setting based in just one building throughout the entire movie. Other than that, The Raid 2 just improves on everything else! Both ""The Raid"" films are my favorite action/thriller movies!",10,"english"

"While adding a far more engrossing plot, The Raid 2 also expands its memorable action scenes with more diversity. The cinematography and fight choreography is astounding.

But that doesn't mean they won't completely exhilarate you.",8,"english"

"Gareth Evans has perfected action eye candy at this point. His follow up takes the story to a grander scale while still maintaining the much beloved grounded action of the first.

The action scenes seem to come from my wettest dreams and they go directly in the Olympus of the best scenes from martial arts film (everyone of them), but between them takes palce an over-complicated story about spies and betrayals.

"The Raid 2 begins straight after the disastrous events shown in The Raid. Our protagonist is asked to work for an internal affairs unit in the police force. He does a stint in prison in order to befriend a criminal and go undercover with his gang upon release. Lots of fighting happens.

"I must say, I really didn't expect it, but this film is better than its predecessor.  Other than the huge action sequences, and the return of Iko Uwais, this has almost nothing in common with The Raid: Redemption. With the first movie's location and color palette, I think ""dirty.""

A film that's simply entertainment and nothing more, perhaps a bit too long depending though on your mood.

"They took all of the astounding action scenes from the first movie, and inserted them into a sprawling crime epic with multiple characters and plotlines intersecting. And it pays off spectacularly.

This movie actually has a damn good story, and despite its…",10,"english"
"I'd heard some mixed reviews of Gareth Evans' follow-up to 2011's excellent The Raid, but was pleasantly surprised by the result. The Raid 2 is a much more expansive film than its predecessor, moving from a single building to a gang war played out across multiple locations.  Rama (Iko Uwais), the hero of the first film, goes undercover to bring down a gang and corrupt Jakarta police. Over a two hour plus run-time, Evans guides Rama and a supporting cast…",8,"english"
"Not as good as the first one (which was like Martial Arts Die Hard, which is an impossible premise to hate), this film still has some great fight scenes, and who are we kidding? That's why we watch these movies, am I right?  This one is a little too long and could have easily been thirty minutes shorter. That said, the final half hour of THE RAID 2 is every bit as good as the previous film. It just takes a little while to get there.",7,"english"

Which we all know so well from the first is some of the best ever filmed.",9,"english"
"Slower than the first yet equally as brutal, The Raid 2 delivers much more in so many ways yet falls short of first in others. All in all, it's a solid film with some amazing fight choreography that's been stepped up a notch from the first, yet I'd probably rate them on par with each other.  Smooth shots have been traded in for incredibly long takes, which does add a certain impressiveness to the set pieces but ultimately makes them…",7,"english"

"Film #1 in my I Pledge to watch these movies this year selection.  In a nutshell: Timely documentary about the dangers of excessive caffeine intake.  If you liked this, try: Watching it again, or a rewatch of The Raid. I'm not sure what stands against these pictures as state of the art action in 2014.",9,"english"
"Contrary to the consensus, I enjoyed the expanded scope and godfather-esque storyline of the Raid 2 immensely, and for that it is my preferred of the series. It has far more scenes, than the first Raid, that have stuck in my memory playing on an endless loop. Brilliant, exhausting and exhilarating.",9,"english"
"Very disappointing sequel. First The Raid was like 20% story, 80% action, now it's the other way around. It would be fine, if Evans had a screenwriting talent that went beyond rehashing Johnnie To thrillers. Two and a half hours is way too long for something you feel you have seen before.",6,"english"

They are all so expertly choreographed and brilliantly directed, they provide a pure adrenaline rush. Everything is visible, the way the action is shot is just so damn clean. Never before has 2.5 hours felt so alive. There is always some energetic and balls-to-the-wall insane shit happening. A twenty man brawl in a bathroom stall. A man who kills people with baseballs. How hype is that shit?!?!",10,"english"
"stop your storytelling and start your bonebreaking...my advice for the next one. Simple",6,"english"
"It's starting to grow on me is this film. The fight scenes in confined spaces stand out the most. As I said previously, this is ""clearly a step up from the first film in terms of scope, budget etc. And there is no denying the talents of Gareth Evans. However, at almost 2.5 hours this needed some serious cutting back and refocussing as it lacks the insistent drive of, say, Ong Bak"". The attention to detail is admirable though and I found myself spotting extra little things the second time around.",7,"english"

It's also too long with too many plot threads following minor characters who in the grand scheme of things don't really matter or influence the story. That said the brutality is higher if a little less realistic than the first.",8,"english"

"A tour de force of flat out craziness. Most brutal and stylish action film I've seen in ages.",9,"english"
"Possibly the most jumbled, over-long masterpiece that disappointed me the first go around and had me aching for a second viewing when it was over. Luckily, about 70% of this film is a near crescendo of manic hyper violence that loses focus when the other thirty percent of the film failed to grab me as a drama.",8,"english"

"What a massive misfire.  Completely forgets that what made the first film so fun was it's fast, bombastic, relentless action.  The Raid 2, dials DOWN the action and shoehorns in two and a half (TWO AND A HALF!) hours of cliche, boring ""crime drama"". World expanding in a sequel is typically a good idea, but not when you resort to this kind of dull plotting.  A real shame, as there are some great action scenes in here, but boy is the rest of the film a slog. By the end I had well and truly stopped caring and just wanted it all to end.",3,"english"

"The Raid + 25% Internal Affairs + 10% The Godfather = The Raid 2.  A very good movie and quite different to its predecessor which was linear and contained. Great fighting sequences (I liked the prison fight where the inmates dressed in ochre and the prison guards in black riot gear clashed in the middle of a large open space, the dirt turned into mud by heavy rains, so that after some seconds all looked alike. It also features a decidedly creepy and scary Karaoke sequence (and this was not due to bad singing).",8,"english"

Off the back of the Raid Evans and co redevelop…",6,"english"
"I thought Raid 2 would have a hard time living up to the sheer craziness of the first film but not only does it live up to the first film in many ways it surpasses it. The action still takes place in enclosed spaces (including one scene in a toilet stall and another in the back seat of a car) so it doesn't lose that claustrophobic vibe and yet the wide reaching political crime thriller that Gareth Evans has assembled…",9,"english"

Gareth Edwards Raised the action up to the next level with this sequel.Some extravagant action sequence which really well choreographed.Acting good as always but I had a few problems, The story was good but at times felt muddled and slightly perplexing.  So stick this on, sit back, relax and let the blood flow but be prepared its bit too long in contrast to the original.",9,"english"
"Some of the best action movies use some sort of confining space as the setting. For instance, in my favorite Christmas movie John McClane finds himself trapped in Nakatomi Plaza with a group of German terrorists. The skyscraper acts as a playground for the movie to take place.

"What's the difference between Saw and The Raid 2? One is small-budget torture porn supported by a threadbare plot and generic characters, and the other is Saw. Okay, that's a bit harsh, but The Raid 2 suffers the same issue of its predecessor: the fight choreography is extremely well done, but no narrative exists to justify it. That's not to say the film is plotless, only that its narrative is of little consequence. Arguably it's even worse this time around.…",0,"english"
"The charme of the first The Raid was in the limited setting, in that way The Raid 2 didn't quite feel as intense. Also the plot was too drawn out, but who would complain about the plot in a martial arts movie. Fight scenes were top notch and uncomfortable at times, this is how it's done. Easily deserves it's PG18-rating and will remain in the top 5 of its genre for a very long time!",7,"english"
"Frustrating, overlong follow-up to one of the most promising debuts of recent cinema history, 2011's The Raid. Action-wise, Berandal is quite astounding: every fight scene here lives up to or surpasses those in the first film, and Evans throws in a gleefully brutal car chase to boot. Drama, though, is not the director's strong suit: for every bonecrunching brawl, there's a dialogue scene here that's equally painful - albeit for very different reasons. Evans is clearly aiming for a Kitano-style…",6,"english"

The shots in this movie were incredible, if you don't know what I'm talking about check this out. This movie was fucking awesome.",10,"english"
"Although the action set pieces are awe-inspiring and the cinematography is to die for, I still found The Raid 2 to be a very standard action movie with many of the cliches you'd expect to find in a Hollywood blockbuster. The smart thing though is that it knows it's doing this so it crafts these beautiful sequences to distract you from the otherwise boring narrative. As a result, The Raid 2 becomes this incredibly entertaining sequel that doesn't replicate its…",8,"english"
"Damn near perfect sequel to THE RAID. I loved this film... It takes everything you enjoyed about the first film and steps it up another notch. Blood, violence, amazingly choreographed action sequences and, arguably, one of the best car chase sequences every filmed. It IS a little long, at 2 1/2 hours, but action fans will not be disappointed. There should be ""Hammer Girl"" dolls on the market, by the way... They better get on that pronto. I'd buy one.",9,"english"

Apparently the only versions my local place has are English dubs, but that stopped bothering me once the fights started. As far as dubs go, I can't complain; the voice actors were good. It's still a jarring thing to see, but as I said, it didn't bother me for long. The first Raid was small…",10,"english"

"I'm glad this picked up when it did. I thought this movie had almost caught the ""shut the hell up and fight"" syndrome. When you go into a movie like this - one praised for its ultra violence and impeccable martial arts performances - you expect nothing less than nonstop intense action from beginning to end. You know the main protagonist is going to beat the ever living shit out of everyone on screen, but most of the action wasn't…",7,"english"
"This film features some of the best action sequences and martial arts choreography in cinema since it's own predecessor, Raid: Redemption... And you have to take special note of not only the choreography of the actors in the fights but of the camera as well... This makes for a very unique viewing experience... I think that only South Korea's Kim Jee-woon rivals Gareth Evans when it comes to action scene cinematography...  That being said, it makes me wonder why this…",8,"english"
"Still outstanding on a second viewing. If I could be bothered to make a Top 10 action films list then this and The Raid would be sitting pretty at the top. Just the Kitchen fight scene alone would make me love this film. I've never seen something so brutal yet balletic in my life. I can't wait to see what Mr Evans will cook up next. Sadly, it's a long wait for Raid 3.",10,"english"
"Sequels undoubtedly undergo double the pressure of the original for they are not only expected to deliver on the promise of the previous films, but also trump them in some way, lest they fall into the egregious category of the Hangover films. And so, we see almost all sequels (good, bad and legendary) trying to up the ante and manage to surprise the audiences by introducing new elements or enlarging the scale exponentially. (eg: The Godfather Part II, The Dark…",8,"english"
"It's more of the first one...which wasn't a lot to begin with. My respect to all the indonesian stuntmen who are clearly giving all they have, but Evans has NO idea how to write a script that doesn't go beyond ""two guys punch each other"" and this goes on for more than two hours. Saying ""these movies don't need good scripts"" is a lie because good action movies can't depend just on isolated sequences to survive in your memory.  The…",3,"english"
"An insanely awesome martial art movie that blends an aesthetic cinematography with manly and glorifying gore fighting scenes.  There's no a typical fighting scenes here, we were served with variety of venues and style of fighting: e.g Venue : moving vehicles, a subway car, a noodle bar, warehouses, a porn factory, tight corridors, a gleaming nightclub kitchen and wine cellar e.g. Fighting style : mixed martial art with bare fist, baseball bat, hammer, kerabit, bottles, kali sticks.",9,"english"
"Let me preface this by saying that if you haven't seen The Raid: Redemption, drop whatever you are doing and get it in ya.  The Raid 2 applies the same formula as the original - high-octane fight scenes, massive body counts and an intensity rarely seen in action films as of late.  Action was my first love when it comes to movies and that will never change, sadly modern day action has fallen by the wayside for Michael Bay-ish special…",10,"english"
"I believe the best way to describe how AWESOME is this movie, is by saying ""It's as good as the first one"".  Directed and written by Gareth Evans, starring Iko Uwais, Arifin Putra, Oka Antara and Yayan Ruhian.  The Raid 2 starts right after the events of the previous film. We go back to probably the same day Rama, Bowo and the lieutenant left the building and we find out what happened to them after that. Rama allies with a…",10,"english"

"The huge, epic scope of its storyline, concentrated on this sprawling Indonesian mob saga, more often than not feels a little convoluted and wobbly at times, and offers absolutely nothing new if you're familiar with worlds in 'The Departed' or even 'The Godfather' had offered in the past.  But by doing so, Gareth Evans adds a certain gravitas to his world of crime where territorial pissing is solved with a hammer and a baseball bat to the face, and countless…",8,"english"
"With two increasingly successful martial movies under his belt, Welsh director Gareth Evans is back with a third, improbably making even further inroads into the world of Indonesian action cinema.  The Raid 2: Berandal picks up the thread shortly after the events of The Raid: Redemption. Ass-kicking cop Rama (the ever stone-faced Iko Uwais), hero and one of the few survivors of the first movie, is drafted by a covert section of the police to go undercover and root out…",7,"english"
"The Raid was 100 minutes of people kicking the shit out of each other over and over again in the same dull apartment room. The Raid 2 continues this banal formula and just changes the locations. We've seen people get beaten up in a dank tower block, why don't we see them get beat up in a dank prison cell? How about a nightclub? What if we see people kick the shit out of each other in a car? This…",4,"english"
"An out of this world sequel!  Gareth focused on story more while still delivering some thrilling and amazing action -- a lovely shut up to the naysayers.",9,"english"
"It has pretensions to be The Godfather 2 but the intelligence and subtlety of the Transformers movies. What's worse, the action, the calling card of this film, eventually turns into a monotonous slog.",2,"english"
"More plot than the first film, and equally impressive fight sequences, but I couldn't help but get a little bored.  Still, great fights and stunning camerawork at times.",6,"english"
"Great fighting, and way too much of it.",6,"english"
"This movie has incredible action. It rivals or surpasses that of the first movie. It's still creatively choreographed and absolutely brutal. It also has a good few gimmick characters that bring some iconography to the proceedings, iconography that I guess the previous entry lacked. That said, this movie is not the first movie. It doesn't have the unrelenting focus, the momentum, or the tension. It is a simplistic narrative, but it's a different kind of simplistic from the first film.…",7,"english"
"Is it weird to call this movie delightful? Not as tight as its predecessor but I think it's ballsier for them to go plot-heavy on this one since there were literally no lulls the first time. The plot is interesting enough that I never found myself necessarily WAITING for the next set piece to begin. It takes a while to get going but when it does OH MY GOD. The final moments made the whole plot worth it for me,…",8,"english"
"DIRECTION Gareth Evans once again brings us an action-packed martial arts action film, the directly follows up his 2011 film, The Raid: Redemption. The fight choreography is nothing short of spectacular once again as you feel every kick, punch and stabbing that happens quite frequently throughout The Raid 2. The action in many sequences is not for the faint of heart, where the violence is harrowing and intense. The last 30 minutes of this movie alone is worth the price…",8,"english"
"As film criticism, this comes as 99 Theses nailed to the door of a burned down Blockbuster Video. Puts to shame hundreds of movies from the last 10 years simply by handling the fundamentals with finesse, then makes the insult personal by combining those fundamentals in more and more complex variations until the unfolding work demands nothing less than your awe. The kind of movie that knows it has your undivided attention even before it takes out the good toys.…",9,"english"
"Blistering action epic extravaganza, The Raid 2 picks up after the events of part 2 and offers even more thrilling action than the original. Director Gareth Evans has a unique style when it comes to crafting an unparalleled action film. He truly comprehends the genre, and what it is displayed clearly on-screen. The Raid 2 may have a simple plot, but that’s fine, for this type of film, the action is all that matters, and with this follow up, get…",10,"english"
"The Raid + Drive + The Departed + The Killer = The Raid 2  If you're an English speaker, you've seen this plot a million times before; nothing interesting or new is done with it, but it's still occasionally hard to follow.  Still, this is a sequel to film where people are brutally murdered one after another for nearly two straight hours, and the action sequences are appropriately exciting and (dare I say) awesome. The prison-yard mud fight and the car chase gun fight are especially noteworthy.  Don't expect more than entertainment, and you'll be entertained.",8,"english"
"It's as bloated and overlong as the first film is pared down and quick. The undercover cop angle is a good one and it fits the main character well but the excessive details and lengthy cast of characters weigh it down. Also, the stylistic choices are fairly amateurish and most of it plays out like a video game cinematic interlude.  But when action starts, it's as good as any other film in the genre. The fight scenes are even better,…",7,"english"
"Like Singin' in the Rain, except they break all the things and kill all the people.",9,"english"
"I'm still trying to digest what I just saw. This was better than the original, but just barely. Half way through the film, I was thinking this wouldn't quite live up to the original, and then it proved to be completely back loaded with all of the best and most mind blowing scenes in the third act. There are fight scenes in this that I still can't believe exist. Some will take the wind out of you, some will leave…",9,"english"
"I know the Director had other intentions for his crime trilogy but I think he should have left them aside. Including them into this movie just made it long, convoluted and confusing. The fight scenes never top the first movie I feel. I guess you cant beat the original for all its simplicity and streamlined beauty.",7,"english"
"Punch punch kick! Kick punch smack! Smack pow bang!  So much love. This film is well over 2 hours long, but you hardly notice it. A superb example of what an action film should be. A plot that is fairly simple but not too silly. Just the right amount of humour. A protagonist that you're 100% behind all the way. And. My god. The fighting. Magnificent fight scenes. I love this movie. Possibly the most enjoyable film I've seen all year.",9,"english"
"Fantastic film with plenty of balls to the wall action and bloodshed. The story is *almost* too convoluted for it's own good. It's not hard to follow, just perhaps a bit much for one film. The only real connection to the original film is the central character.",9,"english"
"I am a huge fan of The Raid: Redemption so needless to say I was extremely pumped to get to watch The Raid 2. It did not disappoint! Every aspect of this movie is more epic in scope and the first movie was pretty epic in its own right.  Iko Uwais' acting has really matured and I thought that he legitimately gave a very great, engrossing performance. There were several other memorable performances and characters. My 2 favorites were Hammer…",10,"english"
"Don't ask Gareth Evans how to bring out the style from action scenes; he totally nailed it. THE RAID 2 is good and all, 'though I have this small but tickling question: how do we distinguish martial art from the art of violence? There are minor parts included just to double up the plot layers (which did not attach that good). I took back half a star and gave it 4/5 instead.",8,"english"
"The last 45 minutes of The Raid 2 are as brutally entertaining as anything in recent history, including its predecessor. In the last act of the film, Gareth Evans shows off his full array of skills; there's a wonderfully inventive fight scene in a car, a wonderfully inventive fight scene in a corridor, a wonderfully inventive fight scene in a kitchen... it's superb stuff, filmed and choreographed with all the brilliance that made the first such a hit.  It's a…",8,"english"
"Listen to me yell about this some more on Episode 109 of my Podcast See You Next Wednesday!  I don't know what movie everyone else saw, but sweet jesus this was a let-down.  The Raid 2 takes a great premise (the prison section of the film in particular) and completely mucks up what made the original film work so well - which was the pacing and narrative simplicity that surrounded the action scenes. This film takes the more-is-more angle on…",3,"english"
"Improves upon The Raid in just about every way. The pacing is slowed down to a considerable and deliberate degree that builds to a climatic frenzy of orgiastic martial arts and violence. If Gareth Evans announced his capabilities to film and choreograph action sequences to impeccable precision with Merantau and The Raid, then this is Evans establishing himself as a filmmaker with a style for narrative as well. Non-linear editing and presentation coupled with a meditative like quality in delivery…",9,"english"
"I can admit; I was in the minority that wasn't blown away by the first film (thought it was overhyped/preferred Dredd).  Although the sequel still didn't quite live up to the hype (I genuinely almost nodded off halfway through - C'mon, it definitely needed trimming!), I did enjoy it more than the first.  While I understand the decision/limitations to go hand-held shaky cam, it still bothers the hell out of me once the fighting gets going (I find myself having…",8,"english"
"One of the best martial arts/action films in recent memory. Different setting and story than the first which gives it a whole new feel. This movie had me in a trance. The fight scenes were so darn entertaining it was hard to appreciate them till after. Go see it",9,"english"
"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  The Raid 2, like its predecessor, is about as high octane an action flick can be. It raises the bar exceptionally high as to how violent, brutal, and really how much action can be crammed into a movie. When it's on point it astonishes, the set pieces like the car chase and the climax rival the highest points of John Woo's career.  But what hinders The Raid 2 is that unlike the first film, it tries too hard to be…",7,"english"
"The Raid is start-to-finish wall-to-blood-splattered-wall brilliant. Every second is brutal and ultra enjoyable. The Raid 2 builds on the plot of the original, just what nobody was really looking forward to seeing. The change in camera styles (It now features a far more Bourne-ish, Hollywood-styled shakeycam) is a step backwards, and the scenes where it reverts to the old style stand out as the best. The Raid is 90 minutes of brilliance. The Raid 2 probably has a similar amount of great parts, but they're spread out over a somewhat flabby two-and-a-half hour runtime. I'm disappointed, but not overly so.",6,"english"
"The Raid 2 is like The Raid, only MORE.  More plot. More locations. More action. More guns. More fighting--a helluva lot more fighting. More blood. More time, with an extra 50 minutes on its predecessor.  The fighting sequences are phenomenal, particularly an early one that takes place in a prison, and another 2-vs-1 matchup involving some unusual weapons. And on top of everything else, Gareth Edwards also managed to sneak in one stunner of a car chase. However, there's a…",8,"english"
"Very rarely does a movie come along that takes the action genre from mindless explosions and predictable plots, to something that can only be categorized as art. Never has violence been portrayed in such an honest and brutal manner, and yet The Raid 2 possess an eloquence to its action sequences, that gives them a maturity far beyond what is usually expected from a movie like this. Gareth Evans has created a masterwork that is the best action movie I've…",10,"english"
"The Raid 2 is a fantastic movie to watch while you're in the middle of something else that doesn't require too much attention. It's full of exhilarating fight scenes with excellent choreography and camerawork, and there are a number of individual shots and set pieces which are stunning in their beauty. Unfortunately, the parts of the movie which aren't those parts drag the good stuff down.  Gareth Evans may have a great eye for and understanding of how to shoot…",7,"english"
"The Terminator 2 for a new generation. Rarely has a film, not just action films, improved on it's already classic and entertaining predecessor.  The ambition, the cinematography, performances, and action are truly a sight to behold.  Merely everything at play here is awesome, although there are a few missteps.  The Raid 2 not only upped the ante for the inevitable Raid 3, but for action films and sequels as a whole.",9,"english"
"The Raid 2 trutly lives up to its hype and expectations, in delivering this godfather of action films with amazing close combat choreography, that made my jaw just drop to the ground along with a complex and interesting story of this mafia familes, with the themes of power, trust and respect, that leads into all out monster third act with our hero.  The first film was just the starter, this sequel is the main course.",10,"english"
"A Welshman makes an Indonesian martial arts film. People cream themselves.  I'm not fighting it.  A Welshman makes a sequel to his Indonesian martial arts film. Improves on said original.  Despite being a tad too long and experiencing a mid-act lull, The Raid 2 is nigh on perfect and a vast improvement on the already amazing original.",10,"english"
"The Raid: Redemption is easily one of the greatest action movies ever made. It is endlessly re-watchable and has some of the best action sequences ever put to film. Well, The Raid 2 surpasses the original in every way and will go down as one of my favourite action films of all time.  The story is very detailed and a little hard to follow at times. That being said, it was a very interesting one that had me curious of…",9,"english"
"Picks up a couple of hours after the end of The Raid, but the story, is bigger,more epic in scope.  And the action. Oh my!  If you thought that The Raid was the best action film for years, wait until you see this, it stamps all over it! From the opening prison fight, right until the final one-on-one fight in a kitchen, itself a contender for the great fight ever on film, The Raid 2 ups the brutality, intensity of…",10,"english"
"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  The classic template for a sequel is trying to compensate for less originality by going bigger and better than before. My only disappointment with the Raid 2 is that it goes for bigger storylines and better characters, but puts a lot of the action aside for the first hour or so.  The story picks up right from where 'The Raid' ended, with Rama (Iko Uwais) on the run from the criminal underworld he's been exposed to,and joining up with a…",8,"english"
"There's something to be said for having one good idea and executing it perfectly: one building, 15 floors, punching. The Raid 2 has a lot of BAD ideas and executes those perfectly, which is a lot less satisfying.",6,"english"
"The Raid 2 can't quite measure up to the incredible claustrophobic tension of its predecessor, but it is nonetheless an extremely well-crafted action film. There's a little bit more plot this time around and while it isn't much outside of the standard crime saga fare you'd see in other movies, it's nice for the characters to have some outside motivations instead of just seeing each other and saying, ""hey, let's fight.""  The choreography is fantastic once again, and I was…",9,"english"
"So much badass. But wait, was that.....a plot?  This takes everything awesome about the first, replaces the 'raw' fighting with much more stylised 'how many different ways can we have badass fighting', swirls it into a twisty crime thriller, adds a bunch of completely undeveloped characters still that manage have distinct personalities and are badass anyway (I'm looking at you hammer girl and bat boy), and amps the violence up to badass level.  My main complaint is that some important…",9,"english"
"Watch this movie in theaters. The production value is ridiculous, the resolution is HD as fuck and everything seems to have double the frames per second of any other action movie.

"Well Damn!!!!!!!!!!!!! The perfect Martial Arts Action film.  I have just finished watching a special screening of The Raid 2 + Q & A with the Director Gareth Evans and what a ride it was.  The plot goes as follows: Pencak Silat expert Iko Uwais is back as police officer Rama, now going undercover to infiltrate a Jakarta crime family run by boss Bangun (Tio Pakusadewo). Rama gets himself thrown into prison to buddy up and ingratiate himself with inmate Uco…",9,"english"

Gone are the claustrophobic close-quarters encounters of the lone tower block in The Raid, the conflicts here take place in more expansive locations; such as prison…",6,"english"
"Never have I seen a movie that felt more like a shrunken miniseries. If this played out on say, FX or something, over the course of six one-hour episodes it'd be pretty much perfect.

If there's one thing The Raid 2 taught me about The Raid it's that a surprising amount of the fight scenes qualities were bred…",8,"english"
"The original RAID was a masterpiece of Aristotelian unity, a pressure cooker environment so intuitively appealing as a home for action film that DREDD wound up being the Leibniz to its Newton. (Sure, everybody's ultimately in thrall to DIE HARD, granted.) Writer/director/editor Gareth Huw Evans, for some reason, decided that a sequel should abandon formula and instead model itself off a talky yakuza film and span multiple years. It's a peculiar choice, made frustrating by his relatively lethargic direction of…",7,"english"
"Abandoning the self contained survival aspect of the first movie, Evans expands the world (and the runtime) to the streets and underworld. The story is cliched and flimsy as anything, and it sags, my word does it sag, but who cares when there IS SO MUCH PUNCHING AND KICKING AND PUNCHING AND KICKING which is just as brutal, perhaps even more so, than the first movie. Sure to delight action fans. I was highly entertained.",7,"english"
"The action is phenomenal.  Everything else is between decent and mediocre, and I'm afraid I just won't ever be on this particular bandwagon (other than the phenomenal action - Hammer Girl and Baseball Bat Guy are fucking awesome, of course). I just didn't care about the story - the writing and directing served the action entirely, which would've been fine if there weren't nearly two hours of essentially pointless exposition about which I cared extremely little. The Raid 1 knew…",7,"english"
"In my review of 2011’s The Raid: Redemption, I discussed its opening shot, a close-up on a gun and watch, heralded the film’s violence and clockwork tautness. Gareth Evans’ sequel to his modern action classic opens on a long shot of a field of crops, grey-tinged by a sullen sky and lacerated by paths twisting through the forbidding vegetation. This opening shot signals the film’s expansion from its predecessor: both physically and narratively, spreading its scope beyond one building to…",7,"english"
"I really loved the original Raid. It caught me completely off-guard and was such a simple movie with wild action. The Raid 2: Berandal is almost the complete opposite: a film with lofty goals in which I had high expectations of more wild action. To keep it simple: Expectations made.  Sure, you have a 2+ hour film telling a fairly familiar crime story of betrayal and daddy issues. But within those two hours you meet interesting characters, albeit characters designed…",8,"english"

Using a bare-bones storyline the film was able to quickly establish the good guys and the bad guys, as well as incrementally increase the stakes.

"One of the greatest martial arts films of late (perhaps of all time) was Gareth Evans' third feature film, Serbuan maut [The Raid: Redemption] - a sort of Die Hard on steroids. He turned down the opportunity to direct the Hollywood-remake (which will alledgedly be with one of the Hemsworth-hunks and use gunplay instead of hand-to-hand-combat, so, essentially, Die Hard) to make a sequel to his own breakthrough film.

"An epic in every sense of the word, The Raid 2 doesn't just work because its numerous fight scenes are inventive, pulsating and visceral, it's because everything is delivered with such panache.

It's certainly not for the faint-hearted though as limbs are broken and throats ripped in wince-inducing detail.  It's hard to see how the…",10,"english"

"FUCK YA!!!!  Listen up Hollywood, this is how you make a fantastic action movie. You use this as an example and understand what makes this movie work versus your boring, shaky camera, heavily edited bullshit you keep releasing. When you're looking at the action, take time to look how they incorporate an interesting story with characters that you want to see succeed. Also Hollywood, look at the fact that this is a sequel, and look at how it doesn't feel…",10,"english"
"Currently abroad in India. Watched this with hilarious but terrible American English dubbing. Fun fact, the character Uco was dubbed by my professor, who was sitting with us in the theater (there was in total like 6 people). It was so entertaining. The violence is beyond comprehension and at a certain point I was like alright I'm just going to close my eyes and wait for the end of this fight.

"The Raid was a video game movie. It had the simplest of plots:there's a bad guy in that building, let's go get him. The bad guy says, ""Sure, come on in"", then locks the doors and challenges the buildings's tenants to bring him the cops' heads. What follows is 90 some odd minutes of the best action ever filmed. It's a brutal gut punch of a movie that has enough comic book and video game in it to make it…",8,"english"
"What a fresh punch to the genre!!! I have not felt this way for action films since the early 90's when I experienced John Woo's Hard Boiled and The Killer. The film does what great sequels do (Aliens, T2, etc.), it opens up the world and gives you much more in character development and story. The direction and editing have also stepped up considerably since the first film.",9,"english"

"Totally lacks the rawness of the first movie, way too much dialogues and characters we don't care about, and the strong guys all have a ""look at me I'm dressed different, I have a different weapon, I must be so wicked"" vibe, it's silly. The story unsuccessfully tries to go somewhere, ending up making no sense.  The fights are quite good (even if they're too pretty most of the time), but 150 freaking minutes long? No thank you.",6,"english"

I enjoyed the more intricate plot here, even if it slowed down the movie’s pace and wasn’t shot nearly as interestingly or innovative as the action.   Speaking of, the action is less choreo heavy and more gory and violent. I preferred the first movies in that sense.   67/100",7,"english"
"Raid 1 and 2 were 2 of my most recommended movies. Raid 1 was incredible. Brutal, gritty, nonstop action and suspense and unpredictable. So much of that film clearly influenced action movies after its release. With all the build up I was expecting Raid 2 to be just as phenomenal, if not better. When Raid 2 hits, it slams, and its costume design definitely influenced the John Wick franchise. But there is so much time wasted between action scenes. Where…",6,"english"
"The stunt and camera choreography in this film are a feat to behold, ramping up the brutality from the first film to a comical degree, though this does clash with the overall film's tone.

Most of the surviving cast from the first film is quickly killed off or shoved aside in favor of much less likeable characters. In the…",6,"english"

"Probably one of the single most influential and important movies of my life for me. Had all my friends in high school watch this, probably multiple times. Saw this one before the second one.   Gareth Evans hasn’t directed a movie since 2018’s Apostle (big fan) and hasn’t directed an action movie since his masterpiece here all the way back in 2014. So very excited for Havoc this year.

"Solid, enjoyable 2.5hrs. But other than the title, director, actor and characters, it's not really much like The Raid at all  (ok, that's a lot of 'but other than...'s, but truly, it's a whole different film).  This is your classic undercover cop / mob movie.  It really isn't the most original story, to be honest. But it's done in a very impressive, very violent way.  So, a violent action movie at 2.5hrs long seems excessive. But an undercover cop + warring mob factions, power struggle movie? 2.5hrs is shorter than usual.",8,"english"

The gunplay in these movies is always a bit of a chore, not that it's bad or anything, by any other standard it's actually super good, but when compared to the martial arts in the movie it falls hopelessly flat. So you end up just wishing they were beating the shit out of each other again.",9,"english"

It’s absolutely brilliant and definitely stands in the (not mine but the) all time greatest action movies ever made. It would be high up the list of ranking was relevant.

At the very least, why has Iko Uwais never had a guest spot in one of the JOHN WICK movies?",9,"english"

"There's a lesson to be learned from Evans The Raid 2, a lesson that perhaps the blockbusters of today need take notes from (looking at you D.C. and Marvel) as this packs a splendid 150 minutes in a way that never makes it feel like it's all slosh or meh or something random to fill out time before the real story starts, with out it feeling all so tedious that those movies manage to do.  After we completed this the youngest kid said, this is the gang that Stallone needs for his next Expendables feature, and you know what, that would be a solid pop-corn ramble.",8,"english"

"10/10  Arguably the greatest action movie of all time. If a 3rd was made, it most likely would be the best action trilogy of all time. It utilized car scenes, gun scenes, martial arts scenes, BASEBALL AND HAMMER SCENES TO PERFECTION. I am always in a good mood watching The Raid and I probably always will be. There is nothing I can say that can live up to this movies greatness so just go and start watching yourselves.",10,"english"

"Boy, I love when directors try something new. Not sure the movie always hits, but I think going south and not trying to capture lightning twice is so smart.  RAID 2 is equal parts prestige drama, crime movie, and absolutely back breaking, wind knocking, and blood spurting wildness. I think for some, the story drags or the way it approaches itself is TOO DIFFERENT — but I personally like it. It’s quite simply not comparable. They’re different. The combat is…",8,"english"

"This film is P A C K E D. The action is as brutal and exhausting as you'd expect, but this time they added more breathing room - the characters are all interesting and the narrative is similar to The Gentlemen but less generally phobic and more visually stunning.

If you don’t like this movie you’re probably lame and boring and I hate you. Grow up and watch real movies.",10,"english"

The carnage and all our violence has been near unmatched for a very long time. And no one has been able to use the immense talents Iko Uwais since these two films. Which is a shame, because not only is he just an unbelievable martial artist, he also oozes charisma and charm with magnetic energy and I wish more directors would use him to his full potential.",8,"english"
"I think the hand to hand is just a tiny bit worse compared to the The Raid, but just about everything else is a cut above. I felt like I was lost a few times, but the atmosphere was so cool that it didn’t matter.

"My favorite moment in the Raid happened at around 32 minutes in, after an extremely well choreographed fight, when I realized that this scene was enough to end most movies and yet there was still an indulgent two hours of violence remaining.

"This is a VERY different film to The Raid, which I can't lie kinda had me worried at first. What makes that such a great film is it's constant sense of anxiety and tension within the one location in between the almost non stop action whereas this film is much heavier on plot, so it's action is a lot more spread out. I was glad though that it doesn't just end up a carbon copy of the first film like…",8,"english"

By far the superior of the two, The Raid 2 has some of the most well-choreographed fight scenes I’ve ever seen.

The story is more expansive, the action was even crazier, and the filmmaking felt slicker.

The Raid 2 admittedly isn’t as good as its predecessor, it’s 30 minutes too long and the story is about as one-note as before, but it’s still awesome in its own way: taking all the cool pencak silat and turning it up to 11.

The Raid 2 decided to take that awesome action and add in some really stylish settings and some cool and creative ways to murder people.

It's definitely too damn long at two and half hours. I feel like Gareth Evans answered the criticism of the first one being light on story by cramming too much story into this sequel. But, it is a fun watch despite the length, and the fight scenes and action set-pieces are, once again, flat-out amazing!",8,"english"
"somehow even more brutally gruesome than the first.  some of the most incredible action sequences with easily the best choreography i’ve ever seen. this movie is such a serve, utilizing its entire two and a half hour runtime with ungodly precision.  i dig the hell out of these movies.",9,"english"
"While this movie is over-ambitious where the first was under-ambitious it still has the same failing as the first. While there are great fights and the stunt work is frankly amazing, there just isn't a single character you give a shit about. Iko Uwais does his best to be a sympathetic lead but they don't give him a single reason to keep charging forward and murking dudes. He's also largely ineffectual to the plot, he's just a guy on the periphery while this mob battle comes to a head.",5,"english"
"A genius meta deconstruction of what an action film should be. It's a complete bloodbath from start to finish and the way Evans and co. blend action and body horror is nothing short of phenomenal. There are also moments of melodramatic beauty that are just magnificent. It's not as well paced or polished as the first but it tells a story on far more grand a scale and does so brilliantly. It's a blast but there's a good chance you'll leave some of your soul behind after watching this. Some of the actions scenes genuinely wouldn't look out of place in Come and See",9,"english"
"I get the hype now.  The Raid 2 is like Sleeping Dogs by way of Jonatan Söderström and Dennis Wedin: a cacophony of brutal and transfixing fight scenes backed by an engrossing narrative. It's unflinchingly nasty in the way few movies I've seen are. While I couldn't recommend the original movie to those turned off by violence, I absolutely cannot recommend this to anyone who feels squeamish by it.  Yet, for all of its violence, there's a surprising layer of…",8,"english"
"This was pretty sweet, but I agree with the plot complaints. However, from Hammer Girl's and Bat Boy's introduction, it doesn't stop being awesome action.",8,"english"
"So I know I said that the 1st Raid was one of the greatest action movies I have ever seen & now the same can be said about the sequel! This shit is just on another level! I’m on the fence as far as which one I like better. I liked the confined feeling of the first one, but I felt this story was so much more intricately layered. These are insanely action packed & detailed with choreography that has to be…",10,"english"
"My biggest complaint about the first film was that it quite literally had no plot. It was just 90 minutes of non stop violence and chaos. I never cared and just waited for it to kinda be over. Turns out, the sequel didn't get any better with a bigger budget or the addition of plot, lots and lots of plot. Instead, it got much worse. So many things about this movie bugged me, so I just made a little list.…",2,"english"
"John Wick but on steroids and Indonesian. Holy fucking shit.",9,"english"

"If this was a Quentin Tarantino film, Julie Estelle's character would have said ""It's hammer time"", which is exactly why this is a good film.",8,"english"
"It's bigger, it's better (like seriously, having some actual cash put into production is such an improvement), and even more brutal. Absolutely loved it.",8,"english"
"Lmao yeah this slams. Kyle and I weren’t crazy about the relative plotlessness of the first installment (that one fight scene is awesome though) and this ended up getting put on the backburner for ages.  Superior than the first insomuch that the fight scenes are at least as good as the first (how are stunts or stunt choreo not an Academy Award fucking seriously) but this time’s there a plot (an engrossing one!) and literally the best car chase ever…",0,"english"
"Easily one of the best Action movies I've ever watched (next to war films). I won't say that the Plot is anything to shout about (both Raid 2 and the prequel), but it's the Action sequences that really brings the film to life. From the scene at the prison, to car-chase scenes, to even kitchen fights - every one of them had incredible martial arts choreography. Super brutal and some-parts disgusting, but such a thrill to watch!",8,"english"
"What The Raid 2 makes up for in more polished, competently put together camera movement and cinematography over its predecessor, it takes one step forward and two steps back with its overly complicated storyline, especially in the second half. For as amateurishly shot as the original Raid was, I had to admit: It more than delivers on what it promises, and so much of what makes it successful is its minimalist story - a team of cops have to break…",7,"english"
"Popped this on for the first time in five plus years, and knew that it was going to be a treat. The memories I had of this film were at the forefront, as I had absolutely loved this when it came out, and had argued that it improved on the first film in virtually every way. As I watched it today, it was the perfect time to reevaluate my position from then. Needless to say, not much reevaluation had to…",10,"english"
"Absolute miles ahead of its predecessor in every department. A far more compelling story, pulpier, more brutal fight scenes and gunfights that pack real weight.",9,"english"
"I actually really enjoyed the story to this movie and the action is maybe better in this movie than the first one. The kitchen scene near the end will always be one of my favorite action scenes of all time",9,"english"
"rama could beat goku",10,"english"
"the first film was a perfect example of how a thriller film in a narrow setting turn into a horror film. to add to its perfection, it was succinct, brisk, and crisp.  this sequel is lengthier, it goes on to show its dramatic storytelling with a lot of responsibility; although i don't have much problem with any of those factors, but it's not perfection. the action scenes are as fucking intense as it was in the first part. but, it…",8,"english"
"It's The Raid with lore and I love it",9,"english"
"There sadly weren’t any hunky nude men wrestling in slippery motor oil but it was still pretty good 😀👍",8,"english"
"Everything the original did, this did better. A spectacular Greek Tragedy of crime, a story to rival Heat or the Godfather, this movie takes place all over Jakarta and tells the story of families, greed and the lengths people will go to to find - and keep - their place in the sun. And in the middle is our protagonist, a man truly in above his head, just barely scraping by but succeeding all the same.  This is a masterpiece,…",9,"english"
"We’re supposed to evaluate work within its context right? Folks, this is one of the best action films ever made.   Don’t disgrace yourself by attempting the English dub. Stick with the legit mix with English subtitles.    Watch the special features - they’re pretty mind blowing in terms of the LACK of 3D animation and the precision of Evans’ camerawork.",10,"english"
"Truly fantastic … a great sequel, it builds the world, continues its prowess in hand-to-hand combat action, and looks better than its predecessor. I do appreciate how the first film managed to tell such a great story in a single setting with such a simple premise, and for that reason I might return to that one more often, but this is probably the better film.",8,"english"
"hammer girl is my new god, this was phenomenal, fucking magically gory",9,"english"
"Quite possibly some of the best fight choreography I have ever seen. 🔨🔨 Def put it’s dick on daddy Baba Yaga’s forehead.",8,"english"
"No, THIS is the best martial arts movie I've ever seen.  With a bigger budget, Gareth Evans' ambitious sequel to his testosterone fueled original is an undercover cop thriller, a mafia crime drama and a martial arts movie all rolled into one. And it is FUCKING GLORIOUS.  Even though this movie isn't action scene after action scene like the first one, it somehow manages to be even more heart thumping than its predecessor. Well written undercover cop dramas always do…",9,"english"
"it's slower and better with more blood than ever.",9,"english"
"Goddamnit, this took what made the first movie great and went beyond. It's insane how amazing this movie is, the story is bigger, it expands to more locations, more perspectives, the emotional side is stronger, the camerawork and lighting are better, the fucking fight scenes were even more crazy.  This was a massive improvement (even though I already loved the first movie).",0,"english"
"No... I'm done  Score: 9/10  I feel like The Raid 2: Berandal is equal if not less than its predecessor. I don't think it's better in general. Sure there are some parts that are better, but there are also that makes this film feel less than the first installment.  This film actually has a plot in it and it's a complex one. I understand what is the protagonist's main goal in general, but in detail.. it's a bit hard or…",9,"english"

"it doesn’t snow in indonesia plsssss  but this is such a big game changer from the first own. this is defo more superior. the action scenes were ofc exhilarating, like the chase sequence and the final battle were insaneeeee. the plot is more content and the way it was shot was way better.   honestly i just wanted more of that hammer girl, she’s so stunning visually and she deserved more action scenes!!",7,"english"

"Some of the best action sequences I’ve ever seen and by far the best fight choreography done in any movie. Superior to the first movie in almost every way, I really enjoyed this one",9,"english"
"A solid sequel, maintains and sometimes even passes the already high level of its predecessor. The road chase sequence is epic!",8,"english"
"The Raid 2 improves in so many levels. From the increased action sequences and flawless fight choreography, energetic direction from Gareth Evans, cinematography, story, characters, and acting, it is one of the best sequels ever made. The film is well-paced, you won't even notice that this is 2 hours and 30 mins long. But, by increasing the runtime, we are introduced to a more cohesive and entertaining story. If the first film is not that impressive in the story department,…",9,"english"
"The story of the raid 2 is confusing and boring, on the other hand, it is the best action movie ever made. I can't even imagine the work it took to coordinate and direct these insane scenes, it really is an unbelievable job.  Stamp ""1001 movies to watch before you die"".",9,"english"
"I subtracted half a star from where I put the original because this movie is overstuffed with plot. It’s excellent, but in no world does it need to be 2.5h long. It’s too focused on the background story, which is fine but it’s standard warring gangs fare. There too many central characters as well, too many threads to keep track of for a movie like this.  All that being said, the real draw is the action and the fight scenes.…",8,"english"
"'Nggak, cukup'  Rewatching this masterpiece come from Indonesia and Gareth Evans. A crazy bloody gore choreography and has a great level of violences that we need.  Need more, please.",10,"english"
"The Raid 2 is completely insane.  We get even more blood, more broken bones and more bananas action. Honestly, it's exhausting to even think about all the crazy things they pulled off in this movie. The fact that we get a well written and well put together Crime story wrapping around the insane action is just all the greater.  I know the sequel was canceled a long time ago, but I'm still super bummed about it. Would love if Evans…",10,"english"

"“Bring back the ball.”  This movie is just as much fun as the first one. The acting was great. The pacing was great. Even more violence than the first. There’s a lot more blood and gore than the first film. Overall a very good movie. I highly recommend watching it you won’t be disappointed.   5/5",10,"english"
"Around the World April #10 - Indonesia 🇮🇩  God bless Asian action movies.   Truth be told, I didn’t really care about the story that much and it definitely could’ve been shorter, but the action is so good that you can let the weaknesses slide. It’s been a while since I’ve watched a movie or video that made me exclaim, “Oh my god!” and cringe like I did with some of the injuries in this",8,"english"
"Simply rips",9,"english"

"the most disappointing movie i've ever seen. no tension. fighting isn't convincing, especially when watched closely after Redemption. felt like they gave up what made the original great in order to create a bigger budget action movie. a couple decent fights near the end",4,"english"
"Yeah this just isn't as nerve-wracking or tightly packed as the original. Maybe cause it's set in an open world and not a confined space where you can feel the tension going from floor to floor.  I will say this though. The opening fight scene in the prison toilet was pretty good",6,"english"
"When I first saw The Raid, (redemption) I was blown away. exhilarating action, leaving me since watched it multiple times with other friends. And each time, left feeling the same. Now, with such high regard for the first one, naturally I went into this movie, with extremely high expectations. I was NOT disappointed. Not even remotely. It was twice as breathtaking, twice as exhilarating, and endlessly more brutal. A stunning movie. Evans, is unbelievable. His eye for what people want…",9,"english"
"One of the best action movies recently released!",9,"english"
"Yeah ok, maybe I was too sleepy for it but this use to be one of my favorite action movies and I really just wasn't vibing with it tonight. Super well made, and the action scenes are next level, but the pacing of the editing during the more narrative-focused scenes was so slow and needlessly self-serious. Like sorry, this story is fine but it's not interesting enough to be taken completely straight. Maybe some David Fincher-esque editing or even light…",0,"english"
"On rewatch I can now say that I slightly prefer the second film to the first. The film is elevated on almost every level.   With the first film, the plot was pretty straight forward but in the sequel we get a lot more narrative. This really improves not just the story but the characters too. This gives the protagonist a lot more reason to care for him and builds more tension to certain scenes.  Also, the cinematography in this is a major improvement and the action really benefits from this making it look even more spectacular.",9,"english"

"The Raid: Berandal is The Matrix Reloaded of martial arts movies. The sequel to The Raid: Redemption is bigger and bolder than its predecessor but that doesn't make it better. (A more direct comparison can be applied to the John Wick sequels, which also share the same problem.)  Since in the first film the invasion of a single apartment block turned to out be more complex than it initially seemed, the sequel isn't afraid to instantly become a sprawling crime…",5,"english"
"NETFLIX  Another top notch action film where Rama goes undercover in Jakarta to expose corrupt police officials. More bone crunching action on a big scale, prefer part 1 still tho.",8,"english"

"this film should be put on the Voyager Golden Record so that aliens know not to fuck with us",0,"english"
"Still the gold standard of outstanding achievement in action movie choreography. Visually impeccable, and exponentially more creative than anything you see in a “Hollywood” action movie- (Fury Road is the only other action movie in recent memory I’d put on its level in terms of scope and audacity) I mean fuck, when’s the last time an American action hero was allowed to drive a nondescript sedan??? The stunt work is some of the best out to film, and the whole movie is exquisitely shot like a baroque gangster nightmare. And don’t even get me started on how fantastic the crew of assassins-with-gimmicks. Essential viewing.",10,"english"
"STOP DUBBING MOVIES. NOBODY LIKES THAT  This one’s not as good as the original, but I’m giving it extra points because I think I would’ve liked it better if it wasn’t dubbed. The action is obviously insane and the story is good, I just liked the setting and the feel of the original.",7,"english"
"The action sequences themselves...Droolworthy...",8,"english"
"Good sequel! The third act to this film is incredible. Iko Uwais is awesome at what he does. I really dont like the bratty son cliche. It gets annoying and frustrating quick. This movie is long too, not a bad thing. But he didn't even get to see his wife and kid tho, come on.",8,"english"
"No one else should ever attempt a action movie. We've peaked.",10,"english"
"This incredible sequel manages to not only crank up the insanity of the first film to 11, but also develops the characters to a much deeper level. Maybe it's better that we aren't getting The Raid 3, I can't see how they could possibly top this.",9,"english"
"Just when you thought the first film was crazy action, this movies like we gotta increase the action ten fold....and man is this movie entertaining as hell.   Maybe a bit too long, but honestly didn’t really mind the runtime because it felt like the film was expanding the world of the raid films and adding just enough new stakes to allow the action to get more and more insane.",9,"english"
"Film #4 of Scavenger Hunt #70 Task #16 - Watch a film that was delayed more than two times.  It's has taken me a long time to finally sit down and watch this and I have had no idea or excuse on why I did. This is a film that is just as good as the original.",10,"english"
"Maybe one of the most badass movies I’ve ever seen.  After watching The Raid two nights ago I immediately bought the two films to add to my collection and the second one did not disappoint. I can understand to some that the length is a bit intimidating at nearly three hours, but it really didn’t feel like it was that long. Every time you feel like you’re about to get bored they through another amazing action scene and you’re hooked…",10,"english"

"I ever so slightly prefer the first movie because I think it's overall the more well rounded and enjoyable of the two. This one suffers a little from its bloated runtime and a few minor parts but other than that, it's also fucking great.  It does do a few things better however; its plot is less simplistic and more enjoyable compared to the first's practically non existent story. This film also has wayyy better characters, the protagonist is slightly developed…",9,"english"
"Pure insanity and ambitious as hell, this is one of the craziest movies I’ve seen. Even though the whole plot fits together logically, it’s really just there to facilitate the fight scenes, which come around early and often, with fun and exciting side characters that keep the variety up throughout the quite extended run time.  Can’t even be mad about any of this movie’s flaws because they are necessary to bring the pure batshit craziness to the table. I love if for how sprawling yet simple it is, and it’s a real ride for the full runtime.",9,"english"
"This is how you make a fucking action sequel. Seriously. This shit just takes out its massive indonesian cock and pisses on pretty much every western action flick from recent times. It is amazing how much more satisfying a fight scene is when you don't cut 3 times a second and can actually see what is happening",9,"english"
"Honestly, this watch made me come to the light a bit on this movie. Don't get me wrong, it is apex vortex (pardon my Pineapple Express reference) hand to hand combat in action movies. The creativity, choreography, and brutality in the fight scenes can't be matched. However, this movie is bloated with story.  I'd hate to say it this way, but it could use a lil John Wick treatment.

There's any sort of action scenes (a mass brawl in the prison yard, a thrilling car chase, fights with hammers and even with baseball bat and balls). The plot is more elaborate and intriguing, but sometimes with too many digressions. A true masterpiece of the genre and one of the best movies of the decade.",9,"english"
"The Raid was my introduction to Indonesian action films and all the carnage that comes with them, and I've been hooked ever since; I found the original to be pulse-pounding in a way that no modern Hollywood film has been able to match - not the ""Crazy 88"" sequence from Kill Bill, not the hand to hand fights in The Winter Soldier, and not even the fights from the John Wick films, Yet, for all the enjoyment of the genre,…",9,"english"

"The problem with doubling down on the punishing violence is that Evans feels like he has to pad out the plot with incessant mob politics and long boring conversations between buttoned-up psychopaths in order to justify us caring about the relentless gruesomeness. At least an hour too long. On the other hand, this is an achievement, and the plodding length and unflinching cruelty only reinforce how committed Evans is to giving our main character, and us, a brutal hell from which he can’t escape.",8,"english"
"Takes it up a notch and is amazing just like the first one. So many amazing fight scenes and the brutality this film brings is top notch bloody and violent!  This follow up improves a bit more than its predecessor and tops it for its choreograph fights, loved the make up on its use for the bruises, injuries, even with some use of its cgi, that doesnt matter as you root on for the main character and continuous pursuing of whipping ass and leaving piles of bodies.",9,"english"

"As for action this is one of the most impressively choreographed films I have ever seen. And to be honest? It doesn't really work in its favor. Every action scene is like coke or Adderall, but after a while it burnt me out with all of the flashy tricks and stunts. Still a great time nonetheless, but a movie I will probably never watch again.",7,"english"

"*Bones snapping*  Top 5 action movies ever made. Not up for discussion. This movie breathes pure adrenaline. The camera work is phenomenal and inventive. The action sequences are some of the most well-choreographed scenes I have seen in a very long time. Each shot is dripping in color and style. Gareth Evans knows how to make his kind of movie and make it very well. I would even go as far as to say this is a masterpiece of the action genre on par with THE NIGHT COMES FOR US. This is a great movie to watch with friends as everyone cringes at the hyper-violence.",10,"english"
"Pretty much on par with the first one. But for some reason it feels a little off compared to the first.",8,"english"
"this is by far the most ambivalent i've ever felt about a movie i'm rating 4.5.  because this is way, way too long & far too cluttered with plot that i did not enjoy and did not care about.  but when this thing takes flight, it truly smokes.  i suppose it's good that they didn't try to recreate the focused simplicity of the first film completely. but they didn't have to abandon it completely, did they? and they certainly didn't have to make this thing 150 grinding minutes long.",9,"english"
"The Raid 2 is the sequel to the Singapore-made The Raid: Redemption (a movie with no redemption but plenty or raid… this new one doesn’t have a raid or much redemption).

But what this film also has is a fantastically deep main character in Rama and an even more horrible bad guy.

The Raid 2 probably deserves to get docked a few points for how strange and scattershot it is.

I’ll admit that despite the acclaim, when I saw that this movie was a whopping 45 minutes longer than the first, I was very 🤨, but it used the extra time well, pivoting from the videogame-y action movie quality of the first and turning it into a brutal crime thriller.  I thought the first one had some great stunts/choreography, but felt it looked a bit bland and the story had…",9,"english"

"I appreciate the fight choreography v much along with the extra-ness of the sequences but I really can’t do a violent action film  👁👄👁 I feel overly stimulated",4,"english"
"The story is better than I'll probably ever give it credit for and the action is just as good as one can expect from the team that gave us the first movie but with more money. It goes bigger and loses some of the streamlined storytelling and action choreography that made the first movie one of my favourites. In the end it still comes out as better than average and really makes me wish more people were making action films like this.",8,"english"
"So let me get the negatives out of the way off the bat. This movie isn't as tightly made and simple as the last movie and the more complex plot means our characters get time to rest way more than the last movie.

"The following review originally appeared on Virgin Media (RIP).  2011's blistering punch-everyone-in-the-building action flick The Raid marked the explosive debuts of Welsh writer-director Gareth Evans and Indonesian star Iko Uwais, as well as doing for martial arts style silat what Ong-Bak did for Tony Jaa and muay thai. The film became a deserved cult hit, so when Evans and Uwais announced they'd be re-teaming for a sequel (subtitled Retaliation in the States and Berandal, meaning 'Thug' in Indonesia), expectations were…",6,"english"
"So perfect My previous 4 and a half was a sin.",10,"english"
"In terms of action, fight coreography and camera-work it doesn't get better than this movie.",8,"english"
"The quintessential Father's Day film. I watch it every year! No film has ever so elegantly or violently depicted the failure of so many dads. The violence itself is perhaps their greatest failure.  Favourite Thing: This movie. It's my best film of the 2010s.",10,"english"
"There was a point early on in the movie where I was thinking it was a huge step down from the original. The first movie was very quick in to the action, and was pretty relentless with it's pace. However, this one is significantly longer, and quite a bit of that time is spent (largely at the beginning) dealing with character choices and laying out all the players in the war that it's dealing with. It's not that these moments…",8,"english"
"Far more expansive and character-forward than its drum-tight predecessor, THE RAID 2 is thrilling, awe-inspiring, and oh-so-bloody. The mini boss/big boss fight scene dynamics are executed to perfection, along with some nifty gangster movie double-triple crosses. Iko Uwais is as good as ever, just as effective in the slower moments as he is in the bone-crunching brawls.  Gareth Evans is a gift to movie fans and this should be first on the list of anyone looking to work in action…",9,"english"
"One of the best action movies ever made!",8,"english"
"This movie would be way better if they just didn't make the plot so convoluted and allover the place. The first Raid movie was good because it was just pure action, and didn't waste time with stupid exposition. Although, the cinematography and choreography is great, and makes the movie worth watching.  Also Uco really was on that incel shit.",4,"english"
"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  In this high octane direct sequel to The Raid, Rama has to go undercover to destroy a crime family and the crooked cops they hire from the inside. This film stars Iko Uwaus and is directed by Gareth Evans. I think that The Raid 2 is the perfect action movie. Well that does sound a bit hyperbolic (which it sort of is) this movie does has everything the perfect action film needs. This film takes everything good a out The…",10,"english"
"This is a good movie. Not as good as The Raid, but still good. The fight scenes are some of the best you will see and there are a lot of them. This is why you come to watch The Raid 2, the action. The Raid 2 adds a deeper plot which is good, maybe a little complex when all you really want is the fight scenes, but it does a good job of moving you to the next set…",7,"english"
"One of the few movies where the sequel is better than the first. The plot of the first translate to the sequel, but the expansion the sequel gives it makes it to even a better one. That goes for the action too, with more of a focus on the plot and character to me at least the action is therefore elevated, not just visually, but also raising the tension surrounding it.",8,"english"
"I love this movie. It is undoubtedly one of the greatest films no one has ever seen, purely because it’s a foreign film from Indonesia. Some of the best cinematography and action sequences I have ever seen. Truly a thousand steps up from the first movie.

"This film has everything I loved about the first Raid film and more. Just like the first one, The Raid 2 is superbly made. Words cannot define how much I love the editing of this film, kudos to Gareth Evans who one again pulls off an incredible feat with this action packed masterpiece. The choreography of the fight scenes is arguably better than the first film and the camera angles are also incredible. The story as well as characters are…",9,"english"
"For an action film sequel, most directors have to extend the scope and have to find a way to up the ante while also staying true to the thing that made the previous film so famous and rarely do people succeed in doing that but here Garth Evans has found a way to do that and more. Here he unleashes pure unbridled rage upon the filmgoing audience with some bonkers hold-you-by the-throat choreography mixed with some excellent camerawork and editing.…",9,"english"
"Upped a star; makes a great if insane double bill with the first by mitigating the shock of a dozen new characters and expanded feel. Makes for a smooth, insightful ride.   Let’s talk about Iko Uwais, surely playing the most unfuckwithable Muslim in movies besides Malcolm X. Like Jackie Chan his appeal lies in his desperate reluctance to avoid conflict, that his nature is contrary to the fight forced on him. Nobility is his baseline.   But the world of The Raid of…",8,"english"

"Still the best action film ever made. Change my mind.",10,"english"
"Just a pleasure to see again. In my eyes this is pound for pound the greatest action film ever made. This was ahead of its time, all in the way it's shot, the choreography, editing, the stunts, the visuals right down to the performances it all works so effectively. The camera tricks are insane, like the car fight scenes are just on another level logistically.  We see a trend now in action films, longer takes, more choreography, brutal violence and…",10,"english"

Unfortunately, it is hurt by the fact that the movie is 2.5 hours…",5,"english"
"Well, that was certainly different to the first one.  The action scenes are still top notch, even if some of the ones nearer the begging lack the urgency to make them great.

Performances were all good enough to make me care about each character and I think the story overall was pretty good too.  I…",7,"english"

"So I just finished Gareth Evans' new show Gangs of London (masterful stuff up until about episode 7 where it begins to get a little boring and predictable, episode 5 and 6 are the best ones) and wanted to see more so I rewatched this which has some very clear similarities to Gangs of London. When it comes to action filmmaking it truly pleases me when we get to see people who are just amazing at their job being able to do what they do best. There really is very little competition when the bar is set this high.",9,"english"
"Maybe the best action film there is.  Just when Rama (Iko Uwais) thought he could go back to his family after going through hell in the first Raid movie, he is pulled back to the fight again.

"Bigger isn't always better but in the case of The Raid 2, it is. Gareth Evans expands on his first film, fleshing out the world and giving us a deeper story with Rama. The acting is solid here and the action is as good as it gets. It's even a better looking film than the first. The Raid 2 is a fantastic sequel that left me wanting more. Do we need a Raid 3? No. Should we get a Raid 3? Maybe not, but if it can come even half as close to the quality of this film, I'm all in!",10,"english"
"Builds on the events of The Raid really well and it expands the story in massive ways. So much so that I think it definitely requires a second viewing. The action scenes are still incomparable and once again it clear to see how Hollywood have learned from Gareth Evens’ film.",7,"english"
"‘The Raid 2’ is practically perfect: a richly enthralling crime saga punctuated by extraordinary action that’s as elegant as it is savage.  Taking place immediately after the first film, it doesn’t take long before a criminal underworld is established and Rama must go undercover for his family’s safety. In doing so, he risks all as he begins another terrifying odyssey of violence.  Primed to quench anyones bloodlust with its onslaught of furious brutality, this Indonesian action thriller is unbelievable at…",10,"english"
"Dont mind Gareth, he just dropped probably the best action film of all time.  I adore the first film and I find the sequel leagues above it. Everything is turned up, from the emotion, to the plot, to the action. Speaking of the action, someone give this man a proper budget so he can do some crazy shit. At 2 and a half hours, this film still manages to maintain my interest throughout and jesus is it visually beautiful. There…",9,"english"
"I didn’t they would manage to top the first one, but the sequel slightly edges it in my opinion.  It drags in parts and suffers from pacing because of an expanded focus in the story, and isn’t always as interesting as it wants to be. However, the cinematography was better here, the characters were more memorable and to a certain extent it was more compelling.",7,"english"
"92% ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️✨  I thought I’d seen the most violent action movies that exist when I saw the John Wick films. Then I saw The Raid. And then I saw The Raid 2, and I’m lost for words.

The characters and their motivations were better this time around, especially for Rama who I cared way more about than…",9,"english"
"The Raid 2 is basically in a whole other genre to the original, and boy does that serve it well. The original is an action movie, this is a crime story.  The superb fights are still there, but spread out in such a way that they act as treats in-between all the mob intrigue. The plot is inherently more complex, though not to a degree that it's to the film's detriment. And, to top it all off, it looks excellent…",10,"english"
"“No, I’m done.”  More violent. More action-packed. However, there is far less at stake here, and therefore the film lacks that edge which made all the action in the first film so exciting and engrossing. But still, ‘The Raid 2’ is a solid action film in itself. There are two action set pieces in this film which left me in awe: the car chase and the kitchen fight. The actor in Iko Uwais gets to emote more in the sequel,…",8,"english"

We find that the antagonists of the first Raid were nothing but the tip of the iceberg, and Rama’s exploits have caused concern amongst the predators much further up the food chain. Rama’s family at…",9,"english"
"Gareth Evans delivers some of the best martial arts action on screen with The Raid 2. The closed quarter sets are insane, particularly the cell where Rama fights an onslaught of foes as well as a fight on a subway train. There are many highlights like this actually but unfortunately the lengthy 2.5 run time really wore on me. Very entertaining but it could have been trimmed down. Look forward to seeing if it’s better on another viewing.",7,"english"
"My memory of the first film was a little hazy as I went into this and the messy opening act trying to establish its characters and motivations did little to help. However, all was forgotten by the time we get to the fight sequences, which are among the most brutal and impressiveley coreographed fights I've seen. The prison sequence is just exhaustingly brutal, violent and gorgeously shot. Mud mixing with blood against the starkly red prison walls. As the plot…",7,"english"

With more scope, investment and freedom Gareth Evans has been able to improve on the original Raid film with a fantastic sequel.  The fight choreography is close to unmatched and the performances are excellent.

This is some of the most astonishing action of the decade, directed to perfection and so exquisitely choreographed that you feel every bruising hit. Though the first film is fun, this is just excellent and rarely boring despite the mammoth running time. Yes it's overkill, yes there are too many characters, yes there's some sub-Tarantino attempts at nihilistic violence that feel pretty juvenile, but it doesn't bother me when I'm this thrilled by everything else being thrown at me. Not a perfect film, but a pretty perfect fight film.",9,"english"

The second one was a bit to much stretched out for me. Even though it had again some of the finest and best choreographed fight scenes I've seen in any action film of the last ten or twenty years.",8,"english"
"I can’t deny that the fight scenes, their choreography and especially the cinematography are up there with the best. It is also plain to see the epic dimension of the ambition to try and take the original Raid to another level. The problem is that in the original they literally and figuratively reached the top level (of the building) and this time around it felt that they tried to do too much for too long.",5,"english"

"THEY DEFINITELY GOT A BIGGER BUDGET THIS TIME  The Raid 2 improves on everything from the original. Better sets, cinematography, an actual story with actual character archs, the gore and violence has been raised, and even the soundtrack is memorable and engaging this time around.

"I was a bit wary of the long run time but I get why they did it, they’ve tried to allow a proper story to support the action and rather than skimp on either the plot or action they’ve instead given the time for both and I appreciate that - maybe it could’ve been a bit shorter but both action and plot were solid enough not to be much of a bother. The story was pretty standard run of the…",9,"english"
"A new peak for action. The stunts, chase sequences, & combat are absolutely MIND BLOWING. Departed meets The Raid! It did feel convoluted though with plot & characters, it's hard to follow especially when sub-plots are introduced out of nowhere. A MUST SEE! Lessons I got from The Raid 2: There is no such thing as a clean war in this world.  Grade: A+",10,"english"
"Finally. After a long while i finally watched the raid 2 without falling asleep like the first time i watched it. The first one is still amazing. The raid 2 just tries to tell a story about Iko being an undercover cop, but loses itself in this chinese-japanese raciscm gangwar story with way to many unexplained side characters like this homeless guy. The action and fight scenes are great.  I really want to see a movie about this bat-guy.",6,"english"
"Another dose of beautiful brutality. Perhaps The Raid 2 has a little too much of it - firstly, it's just a little bit too long. The action never stops being less than lightning quick, but after a while you're breathless but it just will not stop giving you more nasty fight scenes and gory kills. It feels like it's ramped up the ante from the Raid and with the extra violence it loses a little bit from the pure repetition…",8,"english"

"I love the Asian cinema. This is an example for that.  I didn´t watch the first Raid, but it was no problem to follow the story and the character motivations. This is a great indication that the film works on its own. Surprisingly the story was quite complex with many twists and turns. The Raid 2 is so much more than I expected. It is a gangster-thriller a la GoodFellas paired with grand Asian action. The action scenes reminded me…",9,"english"

"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Has the hero of an action movie ever killed more men than this? If the first Raid film was about tight plotting and even tighter action, than this is all about sprawling, undeniably indulgent narrative clashing up against pure carnage. The slow motion that prefaces every fight scene, often fixating on random details like water dripping off a tin roof into puddles of mud, is a nice Rorschach test for the film. You’ll either get tired of it after two…",8,"english"

The Raid 2 were so entertaining that…",8,"english"
"Seriously excellent martial arts film. Though the story is long, it’s excusable for providing relentlessly epic violence: bloody, skillful, cruel, and extremely vicious.  Picking up at the very end of Raid: Redemption, Rama continues, going undercover, to bring down the organization heading the group from the first movie.  Lots and lots of close-quarter hand-to-hand; all incredibly skillful and thoroughly impressive. Several really memorable killers. It’s a true action junkie’s treat.",10,"english"
"Just as good as the first. I was originally scared of the movies two and a half hour run-time because I thought the movie would have a lot of dead space but boy was I wrong, there is not a single second wasted in this movie whether its being filled with plot stuff or kick-ass fight scenes. The plot had enough twists and turns to always keep me invested and the final twenty minutes are some of the best I've seen.",8,"english"
"How much I wanted to love you.  The Raid 2 is the sequel to one of my favorite action movies of recent years... And it's dissapointing. It's everything The Raid 1 was, but more. That means more action, more stunts, more impressive camera stunts... and more plot. The movie is 150 minutes long - For comparison, the first one was 50 minutes shorter. And those 50 minutes are not just more action. They are filled with boring, generic suit-wearing men…",7,"english"

"The Raid 2 has everything that made the first one so enjoyable and then some  Rama could still knock my teeth out and I'd be fine with it. The action is even more brutal and visceral, there's actually a plot, it's shot beautifully and the settings are gorgeous, the soundtrack fucking slaps, and the intensity never stops for its entire two and a HALF HOUR RUNTIME  Also, the camerawork in this film is phenomenal. The camera flows and follows every…",9,"english"
"Not sure how this became the sequel to the original Raid. From what I remember from that it was all action fight scenes to the point of boredom, and all the plot and acting in between was terrible and pointless. This seems to try to address that by making it a sprawling epic in the vein of The Departed. Interspersed with similar overblown action scenes, which often just looks like people flailing their arms about. Accompanied by a dynamic camera…",4,"english"
"Hefty. Actiony. Bone breaking goodness. MY GOD they went to new heights in this film(from the last one). With a plot that may be somewhat confusing if you cant read subtitles and keep track of character names, this film delivers breath taking action and spine breaking choregraphy. This film is FILLED to the rim with action its about the burst. Its crazy. ACTION. SO MUCH OF IT  Definietly need to give it another watch through, but hollllyyyy theres alot going on. If you need your action fill check this one out! It comes with an appetizer, 2 main courses, fruit, desert, and the chef.",8,"english"

The rest is so fucking confusing and convoluted and hard to follow, but enjoyable in an exhausting kind of way. Definitely one to watch with friends who will yell ""what the fuck's happening now?!"" with you.",6,"english"
"Violent, bloody and exhilaratingly action-packed, The Raid 2 is an arguably superior follow-up to 2011's The Raid: Redemption.   The storyline is substantially more complicated and the fight scenes are just as visceral and kinetic (not to mention more varied and creatively staged); think Aliens in relation to Alien - everything is bigger and better. My one hope for this sequel was that it might contain a car chase and WOW did they deliver a phenomenal one! Probably one of the…",10,"english"

"70%  While The Raid was a tight, focused masterpiece of pure adrenaline fueled action film-making, The Raid 2 is a different beast.  The cinematography is STUNNING, and features some really entertaining scenarios involving some hammers and a baseball bat. The characters may not be that complex but they are pretty eccentric and cool.  But I gotta say, it’s a little too ambitious, bloated and brutal for its own good.  Instead, The Raid 2 is surprisingly miserable and depressing to watch, it just…",7,"english"

"A sprawling epic to the original's claustrophobic thrills. The action is as rapid and tight as ever, the characters are more fleshed out and meaningful yet there's almost too many of them - the final act has the best setpieces but feels distant. Undeniably remains a landmark modern action film.",8,"english"
"Better fights, cooler locations, worse pacing. Still a hell of a film but man it would have benefited a lot from cutting a half-hour and tightening up the plot. (For example, that subplot with the wizened assassin: cool location for a fight but pointless.) Big upside was the addition of some bizarre badasses.  Fights ranked: 1. Muddy fight 2. Car chase 3. Train fight 4. Kitchen fight",8,"english"
"Good lord… The Raid 2 took everything the first film did well at and took it to a higher level and made it even better… somehow. And this movie took the bigger budget and benefitted from it unlike most sequels. What I really loved about The Raid 2 is that it differentiated itself from the first film by talking its time and giving some more characterization. The action sequences are still there and are still the greatest, but it also really makes you care about the characters. Definitely watch this film if you get a chance.",10,"english"

"The Raid 2 is my personal gold standard for action movies. Dizzying choreography, inventive set pieces, blistering fight scenes, gruesome deaths, and a camera that's not thrashing all over the place so you can actually see what the hell's going on during fights. The original Raid had all of this, but this sequel adds a sprawling story that's equal parts underworld crime thriller and family drama.  For all its explosive action, though, what sets The Raid 2 apart for me…",10,"english"
"The Raid: Redemption was a brilliant and relentless action film out of Indonesia. The Raid 2 follows right from that film, but isn't quite as brilliant. A lyrical, still opening shot makes it clear it will not have the original's pace. Instead, the heroic cop Rama is sent undercover in the criminal organization responsible for his brother's downfall, and so the scope is greater in both space and time (and kind of stunts). Problem is, we lose sight of Rama…",5,"english"

Can i call The Raid 2 an Action movie masterpiece??",8,"english"
"The scope is much, much bigger here -- and sometimes that's Scorsese-esque and epic, and others it's confusing and a little dull -- but the action is just as intense and just as insane. I really don't know how they do some of this stuff with the long takes, but you just don't see action filmed like this in other movies. Or really violence in general. It kind of rides that line between fun-fake-out-ballet and just plain brutal. And that's…",8,"english"
"What made the first Raid film really enjoyable is the fact that it never took itself too seriously and knew that content isn't its forte. So it stuck to fast pacing and excellent fight scenes. Sadly it's not the case in the sequel. Too much dialogue relying on the viewers' memory of the first film which unnecessarily slows the film and loses the attention of the viewer. The pace is too slow, and whenever they get to a fight scene it ends up being underwhelming.",2,"english"
"Where The Raid was a lean, mean, fighting machine with little story and one real location, The Raid 2 is a very different beast. It's bigger and more brutal in every way. Some of these action scenes with the huge groups are mind-blowing. Props to the team for choreographing such insanity.  The Raid also goes far more heavily on story with a typical undercover cop plot but it's all just in service to get from one set piece to another. Unfortunately it does bog things down at times for me and the 150 minute runtime is just too much for what's happening.",8,"english"

"It's definitely an upgrade from the previous Raid movie but not for what I had hoped. The cinematography and story definitely have a bit more class to it. The shots look sharper and cleaner and the story is legitimate this time, giving us more about Rama. However, the story is what weakens the film the most. The first movie had no straight up plot or (strong) characters. We just watched them as they raid a tower to stop a drug…",0,"english"

"A step up on the first Raid, this one seeks to use the surviving cop of the last film, Rama, to infiltrate the criminal underground, using the failure of last films operation as a reason to get in. The film ups the ante with its fights with stand out moments beign the prison yard fight, Baseball Boy and Hammer Girl, the Bar Ambush, all leading up to the best knife fight in action cinema at the moment.",10,"english"
"A new frontier to what an action film could be. Blending a 'Godfather' like story with martial arts.  It's by no mean perfect in regards to its plot, a bit messy and pretentious at times. But the main drive of the film is the action and the gorgeous visual so I'll let it slide.",8,"english"
"Can we please take a moment to acknowledge the literal marvel that an action/martial arts movie of this caliber exists...      Alright now that we've done that I'm going to explain why this is a literal masterpiece. First, my God does Gareth Evans know how to direct and shoot action. He hires some of the best in the world of martial artists to be in his movies and then proceeds to shoot it in the most risky and daring way which…",10,"english"
"""If I estimated the film has 10 minutes of dialogue, that would be generous."" This sentence from Roger Ebert's review of Gareth Evan's The Raid effectively sums up his view that, despite the fact that audiences love it, The Raid has no substance and is simply a vehicle for graphic violence. While I disagree with Ebert's one star review, it is hard to disagree with the view that, while The Raid has some of the greatest action scenes ever put…",9,"english"
"Much of the second act really dragged for me on this watch, but the final hour being a steady escalation of action madness up to the perfectly choreographed final fight keeps The Raid 2 firmly in my good graces. I admire the narrative sprawl of this one more than I actually enjoy it though, as I don't think it ever quite justifies its lengthy run time. If Evans can combine the tautness of the first movie with the more varied stylings and narrative ambitions of this one then he'll have pretty much nailed his wildly kinetic and brutal martial arts formula though.",7,"english"

"I finally got to show this to my boyfriend. This time around I couldn't believe how quickly this 2 1/2 hour movie went by. I surprised how quickly it took to get to the car chase where Rama is punching everyone. Though it was interesting to watch it again. I only remember the action sequences, I was often when characters were talking and moving the plot forward. I was just as surprised to realize that the action sequences like the nightclub scene tend to stop the movie cold. But they are a frecken awesome way to stop a movie.",8,"english"

"This movie is not The Raid. It’s as though Gareth Evans decided “OK, we have quality, now let’s bring up the quantity to match”. While this movie is only thirty minutes longer than the first it feels like twice that, because this movie takes the time to include a Godfather-esque plot involving a father and son who do not see eye to eye.  And I loved every second of it, even if the job Rama must take is completely and…",10,"english"
"The Raid 2 (2014)- Switches out the confined action heroics of Die Hard for the undercover crime saga thriller of The Departed.

While I found the storyline uninspired and a little hard to follow... those action scenes made this an incredibly fun ride. I really detest when fights are choreographed and shot in such a way that you can't tell what's going on. These scenes, however, were shot beautifully -- they were intense, graphic, BLOODY, and realistic... and they each had own unique STYLE. Fantastic cinematography.  Now I want to go see the first Raid movie (which I haven't seen yet).",7,"english"

"This one of the finest pieces of action cinema. Hands down. The fight scenes are incredible. Brutal, jaw dropping and hard as FUCK. Ikon Uwais really out did himself and has proved he may be the greatest fight choreographer of all time. Even though the movie employed shakycam, the shots were wide enough to see all the action. The story may be the weakest aspect of The Raid 2. With the plot involving going undercover and the intrigue of gangs at war, the story becomes a bit muddled. Story aside, The Raid 2 is a phenomenal achievement of action film and should be viewed by everyone.",9,"english"
"Shaky cam?! Why?! Especially when all the dudes look the same. The frantic camera work makes it hard to follow the superbly choreographed action.  This starts out a bit disappointing and messy but kicks into high gear in its second half. The Raid 2 is still a very good action film but does not quite reach the high bar its predecessor set.",7,"english"

"The fight scenes in this film are unreal, the profound tedium of the story all too real. The Raid 2 is a 90-min masterpiece of action cinema cushioned by 60 min of garbage. Most movies this narratively lacking wouldn't get even half the number of stars this film received. It just goes to show how amazing the action is.",7,"english"
"This film opens with a scene of gangsters non-chalantly assassinating one of the pervious film's protagonists; this is admittedly very effective and immediately establishes a tone of doom and destruction to come.   ...I hope you're extraordinarily impressed by scenes of bad guys who showcase how bad they are by just casually committing acts of heinous violence, because the first hour and a half of the film seems to be nothing but that; no character, just uninvolving violence. It also doesn't…",4,"english"
"Far more expansive than the first with a truckload of new characters, settings and relationships, the balletic violent journey of Rama continues in film not as tight as the first, but still delivers what you could want and more from a talent like Gareth Edwards and a star like Iko Uwais.  Balls (and heads) to the wall action with stunningly gruesome violence and choreography and stunt-work that still puts the West to shame.",6,"english"
"Okay, first off I did not expect that this movie would be as Shakespearean as it was. The plots of power dynamics, father and son, falling from grace were really hyped to a pitch worthy of the bard. Then there is the action, oh lordy - f me sideways. It's crazy intense, Gareth Evens does not pull or cut away, and its perfectly brutal. I mean if a cool looking girl in a white dress and sun glasses stands up…",8,"english"
"First and foremost, I absolutely love it when a sequel begins where the previous movie ended as I think it is bold to try and further build upon characters, settings,...  The Raid 2 tries to do the same with Rama, the bone-crushing, ass-kicking protagonist who almost singlehandedly cleaned up a whole apartment complex in The Raid. Though his story arc remains quite simple, writer / editor / director Gareth Evans does try to expand his universe, going from 'simple' thugs…",6,"english"
"There are moments of masterful camera work, martial arts and tension building, that make me want to love this film.  However the rest of this bloated 2 and half hours is a real slog, as scenes drag on and the simple dual plots of our two protagonists are stretched thin. Rama's story is especially weak and he spends the majority of the movie treading water, until it's time to fight again.  At the end of the film there are several back to back fights that I could tell were technically excellent, but I was drained and tired and no longer invested.",3,"english"
"First time revisiting this since 2014 and while I still think the action sequences are out of this world, I did notice a few issues this time around.  1. There were characters that felt too shoed-in (notably the assassins).  2.The editing was kind of a mess which led to a lack of tension (you need tension for this kind of story), and this untimately didn't lead to a big payoff at the end.  Still, this movie has some of the best action moments in life and a lot more violent than I remember it being.",7,"english"
"Oh dear. A completely tension-free, boring, violence wank-fest that's a good hour too long.  Takes everything that was good about The Raid and does the complete opposite.

The first film (The Raid: Redemption) had impressive action, particularly the second half when they get down to Iko Uwais using just a knife or his own limbs.

"Though I can't say this is Gareth Evans' best film (Safe Haven segment co-directed with Timo Tjahjanto from V/H/S/2 will more than likely forever be my favorite), The Raid 2 is the immersive martial arts hyper-violent film Evans always wanted to make. The story is engaging and the choreography sensational. One of the best films of the year easily, and a step in the right direction from the original.",9,"english"
"It was rare to found a brutal action movie like this in this decade and the raid 2 made me feels like watching a movies when i was a kid, the movie that stuck on my mind and that's what movie should be feels like. even for the second watching although the drama are not well enough but some cool characters and some great fighting scenes + awesome car chase scene all in low budget action package asian movie is definitelly way much more entertaining & so refreshing than a bunch of sick-and-tired expensive special effect hollywood action movies this age.",10,"english"
"8.75/10  Wow! It takes a little longer for the action to hit full tilt, (there's actually a bit of a plot) but once it does it has all the visceral energy of the first film. It is missing some of the awesome gunfire of the first but the hand-to-hand combat is ... just wow!  This and the first Raid film are my two favorite pure visceral action experiences.  If you like this type of film at all and haven't seen it... see it now!",9,"english"
"Trades the immediacy and focus of the original for a more sprawling revenge storyline that allows for more detailed characters and some still amazing fight scenes, during which I can basically guarantee that every minute or two you will see some shit you've never seen before.",9,"english"
"The scene where the main character first gets to his new room after getting a job with the mobsters and talks to his wife on the phone for the first time in a long time really sticks out to me.

Unfortunately, this scene was about as soulless as…",5,"english"

"A lot better than the first part. This time with a real story, some good acting, and more attention to detail. But once again, all the beating, punching, slicing and dicing gets really tiring, and it's brutal as hell. One wishes they would have scaled that down and invested a few more bucks in logic, and sound editing (which is a most atrocious degree of foley sound design ever)",6,"english"
"This feels like a completely different film to the first but really in the end it's more of the same thing. The film is more ambitious cinematically and the writing and performances seem stronger, dictated by the material I guess.

"More ambitious than the videogame structure of the original, Evans also showing a knack for Kubrickian flamboyance - from the Barry Lyndon snatch of Handel to those ultra-wide-angle shots of the ballroom, with its rich reds and golds.

"Rama is a bad ass mother fucker! Even more so in this film than the original. It's rare that a sequel ever matches the quality of its predecessor but this one does in spades. It may feel a bit long in places but still packs an almighty punch. The fight scenes are just as brutal, with even more imaginative deaths like death by hammer, baseball, metal base-bat and even by hotplate! There is much more throat slitting in this film too. The story works well and the end is fitting. A quality action film.",8,"english"

"I wanted to like this one more than I did, as I quite enjoyed the original. And I appreciate that writer/director Gareth Evans tried to do something different: a repeat of the first film's side-scrolling beat-'em-up plot would've been a waste of time. The Hong Kong/Yakuza gangster flick direction was a good way to go in terms of story, and those dramatic elements work very well, even if the plot is needlessly labyrinthine.

"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  After the original movie I had high expectations for The Raid 2. Unfortunately I was disappointed. Although the movie has some great fighting scenes, its plot is full of holes. That wasn't a problem in the first movie because it had no plot.

"My interest was piqued when I heard about an Indonesian martial arts film being directed by an ex-pat Welshman. And when I watched it, I really enjoyed the first Raid film. I'm no great aficionado of screen violence but the fight scenes were incredibly skilfully directed and also a non-nonsense, plot free example of the genre. Very entertaining.  This second film has even more ambitious fight scenes, some of them quite incredible. The prison yard scene and the final fight…",6,"english"
"I've never had such mixed feelings about a movie. The plot is both simple and impossible to follow, meaning it's a terrible plot. The action is tight, fast, and awesome.

Cinematically, this movie is brilliant, as many of the epics shots really are breathtaking. The action is always crips and clear, giving…",5,"english"

"Released in the UK simply as the ""The Raid 2"", Welsh director Gareth Evans wastes little time picking up from the end of the first Raid film, the brilliantly kinetic and hyper-violent ""Serbuan Maut"" (The Raid) (2011).

The movie picks up basically right after the first movie, where Rama must go undercover now to infiltrate this Asian mob. There are so many memorable fight scene this it's crazy. From the bathroom scene, to the car scene, and all the way to the end with the kitchen scene it's EPIC! This movie is…",8,"english"

Super cop Rama must now go deep cover to take down corrupt cops.  If you can't keep track of all the players,it's ok. Don't get to bogged down in the gangster heavy plot. I'm not saying it's bad at all but it may be a tad confusing on a first watch. Many actors…",10,"english"
"Perfectly executed action film.",9,"english"
"Gareth Evans has really outdone himself here. I enjoyed the first movie a lot, but this one takes everything up several notches. The action delivers big time. Whereas the first film was contained to one setting, this one makes great use of various environments including a train, a nightclub, and a mud put, to name a few. The violence is both wildly over-the-top and shockingly brutal. Evans builds momentum in a way where each sequence is not only bigger and bloodier but also packs a heavier emotional punch all the way to the near perfect climax. I'm completely on board for a Raid 3.",9,"english"
"An action film for all to enjoy, a great choreographed martial arts films, that takes the action genre to a whOle new level. With awesome characters and assigned weapons makes this film one of my favorites of all time. One thing I noticed is that they used the main assassin villain in the first film and put it in the aecond, imo, it could get a little confusing if you don't follow the story line. Above all, it's a great ass kicking good time.",10,"english"
"I really liked all the kicking and punching and shooting and cutting and clubbing and batting and hammering and pegging. All the action leaves you breathless. Great movie that was good because it could have been a bit shorter. Much better story than the original.  P.S. The fight between Rama and the bad guy with little knives was bad ass fantastic. Great kung fu.",8,"english"

Engrossing, exciting and engaging this is a film that delivers in every way possible. Absolutely enthralling.",10,"english"

"The Raid 2 eclipses the original in every way which was a tall order!  The Raid had a great structure that allowed it to go for broke from start to finish. In a lot of ways it is kind of the perfect martial arts film. Skinny on plot, fat on fighting. I loved it.  The Raid 2 isn't the perfect martial arts film... it's a great FILM.

The action is still superb, but the plot is not as inventive or original as it tries to be. Plus, there's the fact that it's just too damn long.  Maybe my expectations were too high since I really enjoyed the first one and heard good things about this. Not a bad sequel by any means, but I still prefer the first one. Maybe I'll like this better after the inevitable rewatch but for now it's just a good action film.",6,"english"
"Gareth Evans takes all the potential from The Raid, opens up the world, expands the story, throws in some memorable characters and constructs some of the finest action scenes seen for some time. My favourite film of the year so far.",10,"english"
"Despite its critical acclaim, some (not me!) felt that the first Raid's weakness was its script (or lack of!). But this is precisely what made it so radical and enjoyable, the director having such confidence in its film that he eschewed any kind of traditional narrative.  Ironically, by increasing the scope and ambition of his world, Gareth Evans makes this sequel far less original. The story of corrupt cops and gangster underworld has been seen so many times before and,…",5,"english"
"The only complaint I have is what others have said about the unoriginal plot. Seen it a many times before.  But it has some really violent and bloody fight scenes, but in a good way, I enjoyed the crap out of this movie. Yeah after I felt filthy and needed to take a shower, but there was at least 8-9 times I said Holy Sh*t to myself.  It didn't have stupid cop characters like the first one, but had some great bad guys like hammer girl, baseball bat guy and the homeless looking crazy assassin.  It's so crazy and violent, it just works like gangbusters.",9,"english"
"This movie has some of the most exciting, fun and gory action scenes I have ever seen. It also has over an hour of complete filler in the form of a wishy-washy storyline that seems to last forever, going through all the paces of a very mediocre Japanese Yakuza-tale despite being set in Indonesia. If this film had the story of the first film, while maintaining the exhilarating action, it would be one of my favorite action films bar none. But it has that damn story.",7,"english"
"This is the greatest action/martial arts movie ever made.",10,"english"
"Not so much a sequel as a remake, director Gareth Evans fancies himself an auteur in this one and maybe felt a little guilty about the streamlined narrative and generic pleasures of the Raid Redemption. As a result, the cop-corruption backstory doesn't marry as well with the various action and fight sequences and I really felt the length, too.  Still, as expected, the fights are great, if over-processed, and it really is some achievement if I can be wowed by a car chase. It's pretty badass.",6,"english"
"It may be a little long but The Raid 2 advances superbly. It doesn't follow the non-stop action trait of the first film, giving a lot of breathing room between the fight scenes.

The introduction of even more comic book styled villains was an interesting act, with the comparative lack of CGI it proves that you can create super-humans…",7,"english"

The film drew out repeated exclamations and reactions from myself and everyone with whom I saw it as Evans has definitively stamped his brand on the action genre and left his peers in the dust.

"Ugh.  What irritates me the most about this sequel (and a general grievance for the pattern that sequels fall into) is how a simple, solid concept drives the first film, but the second one is an amped-up, long-winded attempt to out-bedazzle the original.

"In the first 30 minutes of The Raid 2 I was worried that the plot would get in the way of the movie's true pleasures and that it would be inferior to the first movie. But my fears were unfounded. This is even BETTER than The Raid. Sure, having all of the action of the first movie take place in one building was fun, but Gareth Evans had to change it up if he wanted this to be more than…",9,"english"
"The Raid 2 is a huge mess with some great, although slightly too shaky and over-the-top, fight sequences. Gareth Evans attempts to branch out from the claustrophobic apartment complex that made the first film an amazing ride, with its simple story and amazing fight choreography and cinematography. Here though, he expands the scope of the story 100x more than he should by introducing a confusing and poorly developed tale of rival gangs that have been getting along, until the son…",5,"english"
"Shot and plotted less scrutably than the bare-bones first, to the detriment of some GREAT scenes. That is to say it's not quite as good as its glorious predecessor; it's merely very good. The two movies are fairly different beasts and I think they'll settle as complimentary.",8,"english"
"35mm: Utterly disappointing sequel to one of the best action films in over a decade. I always felt it's wrong to dislike a movie because it isn't what you think it should be. But that's what I was doing an hour and 10 minutes into this movie. At the 1 hour and 10 minute mark, I checked my phone for the time. I wanted to actually walk out. Not because this was a bad movie. But because it wasn't the…",5,"english"
"Game-changing action film that improves on everything the original lacked. You know, pesky details like having a plot or characters. Those are actually in this one. Great gore, great action choreography, great direction, great cinematography, the whole thing exceeded my expectations in every way, especially since I was one of two people to hate the first one.  If there's any action character more memorable than Hammer Girl this year I'll eat my hat.",9,"english"
"Not content with making one of the most visceral action films of the last decade, Gareth Evans returns with this sequel, an exhilarating and staggering tale set in the world of Indonesian cops and gangsters.  It’s not perfect; the plot is a little convoluted in places and whilst Rama (Iko Uwais) is always at the heart of the action, his character feels a little sidelined. However for everything I didn’t like about The Raid 2, there are dozens of reasons…",9,"english"
"this is one gory movie.  i LOVE the first raid and this was really good.  this was originally another movie that was rewritten into raid continuity and it shows. a little too much time was spent setting up this movie's connection to the first film. one could also make the case that the plot is needlessly overcomplicated but halfway through it kicks into overdrive and nothing else matters.  this is way more fun on every level. from bigger fights to flashier settings to more colourful assassins.  a 2 hour cut of this movie would destroy worlds.",8,"english"
"The Raid: Redemption was one of the most thrilling, exciting, intense, relentless, violent films I've ever seen. A true thrill ride, it was unlike any other film I had ever seen before.  The Raid 2: Berandal picks up right where the first film left off. In fact, two-hours the last film left off. However, where the first film succeeded in it's simplicity, Berandal becomes bogged down in overwrought, contrived plotting.  Sequels are hard, and there are very few that manage…",7,"english"
"In which Gareth Evans attempts to expand the brisk, nasty B-movie efficiency of the first Raid into something akin to the more sprawling and epic examples of John Woo's ""heroic bloodshed"" films. It isn't a flawless transition; longwinded scenes of criminal intrigue borrowed from everything from The Godfather to Infernal Affairs provoke a certain ""when do they get to the fireworks factory"" feeling. (And not to badmouth Iko Uwais, whose martial arts skills are as jaw-dropping as ever, but acting…",8,"english"
"This really is one of those films where there aren't enough superlatives to describe it. Incredible action sequences and BRUTAL fight scenes.  After seeing the two on one fight towards the end of the first one, I didn't think ANY film could top that until this came along and topped it, tailed it and sent it on it's way.  If Father Christmas is listening, please cast Tony Jaa in the 3rd one and let him and Iko Uwais go at it. I won't ever want for anything ever again. Thanks.",9,"english"
"Bigger, bloodier, and more ambitious than its predecessor, Evans expands the sequel in both action and plot terms. Despite the expanded running time, adding nearly an extra hour to the first film's 90 minute run time, the film's characters are barely elevated beyond the place holders of the first film. Relying on archetypes and gimmicks the film's familiar narrative arc serves solely as a grounding for the action. As such, The Raid 2 is successful in providing context for the…",7,"english"
"Trades the nonstop intensity of the original for a grander, sprawling crime tale.  The increase in plot and character development is welcome, but doesn't always work well. The Raid: Redemption had less of that overtly, but the fight scenes felt so deeply tied to Rama as a character that it managed to say a lot without actually saying anything. We were shown so much about his journey for survival, and the impact of violence on a peaceful person that the…",9,"english"
"In 2011 a small film hit the US in limited release named “The Raid Redemption” which took critics and action junkies by storm. It featured little to no story almost and intense balls to the walls action.

We might as well start off with the worst thing in…",8,"english"
"While I still prefer The Raid for its fights, The Raid 2 definitely delivered in terms of execution, story, creativity, & bad-ass fight scenes. This is a seriously awesome movie, with very little to complain about.  ...Which leads to my one complaint. Apparently this was just me? So feel free to skip this paragraph. But for some reason, some of the fight scenes (especially early on) just looked...strange. One scene looked like it was in fast forward, which was off-putting. I…",8,"english"

"More violent than a wedding in Westeros. The best shot action you can hope for. Running 2 and a half hours it could do with some of the ""plot"" and ""character development"" because, let's be honest, who gives a fuck.

But when it goes into full kicking ass mode.... my god, the whole audiencescreaming was screaming and clapping",8,"english"
"Seeing The Raid was an eye-opening experience for me. The action was so much better shot and so much more exciting than anything I'd seen in a long time, and there was SO MUCH of it! The premise is that a team of S.W.A.T. guys enter an apartment complex and work their way from the bottom floor to the top floor, beating the hell out of everyone they see along the way. That's about it. It's an action film entirely…",8,"english"
"“Bring back the ball.”   ‘The Raid 2: Berandal’ is one of those sequels that just can’t surpass the original. You could say that it can hold its own against the original, but just barely. This film is way over bloated with so much padding that you just want them to get back to the fighting and quit going on about these mob politics that we don’t care about.  Although this movie jumps around in time a lot, it does pick…",7,"english"
"The original Raid was a tightly constructed affair, with nigh an ounce of fat, much like Iko Uwais, it was ruthlessly efficient. Unfortunately, a few years down the line, the sequel has been piggin' out on the deep fried mars bars. The story is rather bland and overly long and to be honest, it left me a bit bored; just awaiting the next action set piece. Don't get me wrong though, its still wildly entertaining, with plenty of gore and amazing action. It just could have done with a more efficient, better story to match the razor sharp action.",6,"english"
"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  The action is too damn amazing for me to give it less than 4.5/5!  THAT BEING SAID...  It probably deserves 4/5.  Criticisms: 1. too long! (choppy narrative can't sustain runtime.) 2. scope exceeds grasp (not the sprawling epic it wants to be. plus, it never fully commits to the undercover cop premise.) 3. gun use is eye-rollingly convenient (missed the gratuitous close-up gun kata of its predecessor.) 4. drop off in suspense (nothing on the level of the wall hiding…",9,"english"

"Rarely does a film sequel meet the standards of the first production but in The Raid 2, we see the standards easily met and built upon to create a truly marvelous action film.  The film focuses around our famous protagonist Rama, and not only has he brought more guns, fighting moves and bad guys, he's also brought a story. New, major characters are introduced and expanded upon effectively, with minor, interesting characters being woven into the plot seamlessly, each one…",8,"english"
"There's a great 100-minute action film in there somewhere, but you'd need to get rid of the 50-odd minutes of elderly gangsters eating their dinner to get to it.",6,"english"
"Great action, bloated story. I loved The Raid. That movie was a tight genre picture that knew exactly what it was and executed it with brutal efficiency. The sequel keeps the brutality, but sprawls and digresses in counterproductive ways. While a straight redo of the first film's good guys take on bad guys in a building plot would have been misguided, Evans layers on too much stuff here and distracts from his true talents. The action scenes are as brilliant…",8,"english"
"So far in my life this is the first and hopefully only time I saw this. The story got in the way of the action.  Writer, editor, director Garath Evans needs to ask himself, ""Does anybody give a shit about these characters?"" He didn't so we have to sit through an overly complicated mix of characters who show up once then in the next scene their in die.  The action is top notch and saves this film. This could have been a masterpiece of action, if they cut out half the movie.",7,"english"

Thankfully in the main the hype is justified. Once again the close hand…",9,"english"
"Seeing The Raid 2 in a theater, I couldn't help but notice the comparisons to John Woo's classic Hard-Boiled: over-the-top action, a director who's mastered the craft of shooting intricate scenes yet keeping everything legible, and a plot that's probably 20 minutes too long.  Too much time is spent setting up all the pieces, and so many conversations are about people not on-screen that it gets a bit confusing...but then all that preparation pays off any time fists, bullets, or…",9,"english"
"The Raid is now a first act(a long first act) in a Bigger crime story, Raid 2 builds on those foundations and creates a bigger world for a ambitious Crime underworld, The action once more Violent over the top and Brutal, and mixes well with the plot at hand, not as tight as The Raid, but that's for a reason and the heavy plot justifies it through. Gareth Evansonce again proves he is a Raw talent.",9,"english"
"When it Raids, it Pours. If the transition to sprawling crime epic sacrifices some of the original's focus, it makes up with surprisingly effective character work and several of the finest action scenes ever made.",10,"english"
"The best action film I’ve ever seen. Hyperkinetic but never rushed. Brutally, sadistically coherent. Shot with the utmost consideration and respect for space and geography, edited with graceful, natural pace and precision. Visual poetry. What we have here is not the next John Woo. No, this is the work of the one and only Gareth Evans, now a fully-formed auteur.  One of the greatest sequels of all time, The Raid 2 surpasses its excellent predecessor in every respect. In terms…",10,"english"
"Huge letdown from Evans, who seems too in love with empty camera tricks to tell an affecting story. While the action does ramp up as the film goes on, it's an all-too-gradual slope that feels like it will never end. Fight sequences felt much more repetitive than the predecessor (throw objects at largest of guys to ward them off, break arm/leg of nearest foe, smash head into wall/ground, repeat).",4,"english"
"Cripes 4 and a half little stars for an action flick?  Yup.  Even this bloke, who moans if he sees a running time longer than 100 minutes was fine with this running for 150 minutes.

It's not an original story, but it one that sucks you in, you have to know what happens…",9,"english"

"I have no time to write a long review so I'll do that another time, but I just had to write something because The Raid 2 deserves it, dammnit.

The action itself is bigger and better than the original, but its the story that really makes it something special. A true crime epic full of memorable characters…",10,"english"
"The boldest, most surprising thing about The Raid 2 is how far removed it is from the original in almost every way. The Raid was a siege movie, self-contained, dirty and visceral, much closer in look and feel to a horror film whereas its sequel, titled Berandal, is a grand, sweeping crime saga. It’s Heat with martial arts. I know that Berandal existed as a story in Evans’ mind way before The Raid and was subsequently tailored into a sequel…",8,"english"
"I can forgive the slower moments of convoluted plot development because of two wonderful fight scenes: the prison yard fight, and the final showdown with Baseball Bat Man and Hammer Girl.  Boy this movie is long though.",8,"english"
"Yes, it's too long and the plot isn't that original (or compelling). But this is not what this film is about. Story is secondary as the fights take front and center. And there are enough action set pieces for 17 movies. And each one is more impressive than the last. It's beautifully brutal. I felt like a kid again, watching my first R rated film. All around me, people would gasp and laugh. Like a never ending 'fuck, they did…",8,"english"
"Better the second time.  The only complaint I can really come up with (and it's a minor one at that) is that the soundtrack isn't as good as it's predecessor. It doesn't punctuate every blow in the same way as the non-Indonesian soundtrack did for The Raid. Whether or not that has anything to do with Mike Shinoda not being involved, or too much involvement from Aria Prayogi and Fajar Yuskemal I'm not sure.  I'm now 100% certain that I…",10,"english"
"I missed the straightforward simplicity of the first installment but I can't fault Evans for expanding his scope and scale. He ups the ante on his action but the crime politicking occasionally gets convoluted and every once in a while dull. Luckily these more flaccid moments are brief and abruptly followed by exquisite brutally balletic action.",8,"english"
"It's probably unhealthy how much I loved this movie.",8,"english"
"It's a big improvement over the original. The action scenes are far better: more brutal and more creative. The story is a total write-off, but at least there's one there this time. If The Raid 3 has a GOOD story, it may very well be as good as people think the first two are.",5,"english"
"Insanely, brilliantly savage. More gore and more extreme than the first film, with a bigger scope and a more sprawling narrative. I think by turning the sequel into a larger crime epic you lose some of the snappy fluidity and brevity of the first film, though it more than makes up for it in pure, unadulterated action. There's so much amazing, inventive action in this film, and it only gets better as the story progresses. Horrible, brutal and so deliriously fun.",8,"english"
"2011’s The Raid impressed audiences with its minimalist plot and masterfully choreographed action sequences, leaving them gasping in unison at a bone-crunching display of martial artistry. Writer-director Gareth Evans and star Iko Uwais’ collaboration quickly sent waves through the action film community, with new fans eager to see where the ambitious duo would go next. The Raid 2 finds Evans and Uwais making their claim to the action throne with a crime epic full of action exceeding that of the original, but weighed down by a plot that treads a heavily beaten path.

"Despite all my excitement I was a bit worried when I heard it was over two hours long and based on a screenplay originally intended as a standalone film. I thought it might be self-indulgent and lose a lot what I enjoyed about the first. I was... oh maaaaaaaan.  The story ditches the elegantly simple and dramatically taught setup of the first, leaving behind all key surviving characters except for our hero.

"Continuing directly on from events in the first film, Rama (Iko Uwais) goes undercover to expose corruption between the cops, politicians and the two rival gangs who hold an uneasy truce. In prison he makes friends with Uco, the ambitious son of Banggun, and as loyalties shift and double-crosses abound, so the conflict between Banggun and Goto leads to bloodshed, with Rama caught in the middle of it all.

"Virtually all the stars given are for the action - the setpieces and choreography are pretty much peerless, a couple in the 2nd half probably bettering the first film (special nods to the Subway scene and the car chase) but as a film this basically stinks - hugely overlong, extremely convoluted and just an all-round mess in terms of characterisation, script and plotting. It's also much gorier than the first (close to splatter levels at times) which I didn't think…",7,"english"
"Non stop bloody violence, perfectly choreographed in a thrilling gore fest. A bigger, better storyline than the original and some fantastic scenes I'm already dying to watch again. You do not see this level of action coming out of Hollywood, and for that I give it 4.5 stars. The ending could have been better for the full 5. Impressive nevertheless.",9,"english"
"Unrivalled brutal violence with a plot far superior the first Raid. Plus it's got a great visual style and some colour this time... mostly red mind. All round great.",9,"english"
"An entirely different beast than its predecessor, for better and worse. It's significantly more ambitious structurally and narratively, attempting a complex, sprawling gangster yarn. It doesn't always work, especially in the first half, when it seems like an excuse to get to the initially infrequent, kinda unmotivated fight scenes. It improves drastically in the stellar second half—well, improves isn't the right word, but coheres. It's not until the end of the movie that you see the long game the movie's…",8,"english"
"Easily one of the best action movies I've ever seen and the closest thing you'll get to injecting adrenaline into your eyeballs without actually doing so. The Raid 2's convoluted, somewhat paint-by-numbers storyline and relentless gore are rescued from puerility by some masterful direction here.

The story takes place mere hours after the end of 'The Raid' with our main character Rama being pulled back into the world of the undercover cop.

Portentous ""the fight... is about... to start... as soon as we return to normal time"" moments aside, the individual components could hardly be better. Loved it, scene by scene. But too many scenes to quite survive the increasingly obvious tension between grim drama and action choreography.  Really I wanted a whole film about Hammer Girl and Baseball Bat Boy.",8,"english"
"The Godfather Part II to action films. Long, brutally beautiful and ultraviolent. Gareth Evans is a director with immense talent and he shows that with a film that defies the original film. Not only are there a dozen of action set pieces expertly crafted but there is a sprawling story that has implications on the characters, not just using them as vessels for kicks to the head. I am counting down the days until I can see it again.",10,"english"
"Obviously I loved THE RAID 2. But as of right now, I actually consider the first one the better film.  THE RAID 2 does expand on the first one in scope and complexity, though, so in time I may come to love it as much or more than the first.  For now I love a lot, but the length feels unnecessary, the story occasionally challenging to follow, and some characters feel like cartoons existing in an otherwise real world. All of these things could eventually become things I love, actually. But for now they make this film great instead of greatest.

Seeing this at the beginning I was mostly excited for it but I was slightly underwhelmed with how the storyline took place. Some parts of the story seemed simply unnecessary and there was more you could ask of in some parts. Still a great movie but I think it tried too hard to create a story but jumped all over the place in doing so. This…",8,"english"
"The action in this is even better than in Part 1, and way better filmed.  However… for a sequel to The Raid, which was basically non stop action for 90 mins*, The Raid 2 has far too little action scenes. And way too much plot. At no point did I understand who was fighting who or why, I was just happy when they did fight. Cause again, the action scenes here are beyond amazing. 100/100  * I thought this would be non stop action too. In a prison this time. I was very wrong.  Private screening",8,"english"
"After surviving the rampage in the apartment block special forces officer Rama is sent undercover to expose the corrupt police officials colluding with the crime families of Jakarta's criminal underworld. The stakes are higher than ever.  The action and violence more visceral and more in your face than ever. The stunts are as good as if not better than anything out of Hollywood. What is most striking is how beautiful this film is. The love and attention that goes in to so many of the sets and the cinematography is at times jaw dropping.  www.starandshadow.org.uk/programme/event/the-raid-2-raid-retaliation,6638/",0,"english"

"I remember thinking The Raid was incredible the first time I watched it and I really wanted to like this sequel… but I think Gareth Evans learned the wrong lessons from the success of the first film. In this case more does not equal better. Yes, there are some badass fight sequences and kinetic camerawork that I get physically exhausted just watching, but The Raid 2 is overwhelmed by so so much plot. I mean an absurd amount of plot.…",5,"english"

"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  (There's a minor spoiler for the first Raid movie below.)  There are several scenes in this action sequel that draw out those oft-used descriptive cliches; yes, at its best The Raid 2 is most certainly balletic, kinetic, bone-crunching, brutal, punishing and, indeed, adrenaline-fuelled. (All set to a 'throbbing' soundtrack.) But there's also an hour of fairly unsuccessful character work and stodgy set-up to plough through, too, and I think that's why I prefer Gareth Evans' original Raid movie. With cops…",6,"english"
"Marked improvement over the already excellent first entry. A few returning faces but for the most part, this feels fresh. Instead of just one apartment complex, now we are thrust into various environments and the action is dialed up to 11. The fight scenes are the only thing that matters here. I couldn’t have given a damn about the plot. These dudes kick the shit out of each other and it’s glorious. You feel every punch and kick. The camera…",9,"english"

"In going for a larger scale and a more complex narrative I think this sequel almost managed to lose what the original brought to the table. This still had really impressive fight choreography and some amazing action sequences but the choice to scatter them amongst dramatic scenes rather than letting the chaos carry and speak for itself meant that I didn’t derive the same level of enjoyment from this continuation of the story. From characters returning from the dead without…",6,"english"
"I appreciate this film but I found some parts of it boring. The fight scenes were still amazing and were the best part of the film in my opinion. However, I found some things in this just didn’t add up and there was some plot holes.  Would watch again but not any time soon, I know I’m in the minority on this one.",6,"english"
"83  The first half of the movie was so boring and unpleasant that I stopped watching it and decided to watch it later. So now, after 3 weeks of delays I got to watch it and it was low key amazing. The beautiful choreography is top notch as always, the decorations, the really strange twists in the end were great too. If they did not ruin the first half so bad, then it would probably be a 10/10 movie and the best action ever made",8,"english"

"After watching the The Raid: Redemption, which I loved, I had hopes for The Raid: 2. The Raid: Redemption was a tight action master class, with a lot of subtle but influential tactics. Although I didn’t enjoy The Raid: 2 quite as much as the first overall, this film without a doubt ups the ante both creatively and cinematically.   The intro is gorgeously shot, and sets the tone for other grand shots that are consistent throughout. A highlight of the film. This…",8,"english"
"The Raid 2 (2014) expands upon its predecessor in almost every way, but the key word is “expands” rather than “improves”. It’s well known that bigger isn’t always better; in fact, it usually isn’t. A direct comparison isn’t always useful, though, especially since this ambitious sequel is a different beast entirely to the insular first flick. It’s also a great film in its own right.  Evans essentially asks “what if Michael Corleone didn’t just shoot those guys in The Godfather (1972)? What…",8,"english"

The first film was so good because of its simplicity and raw fighting style, now we have hammer swinging goofball thugs that look like they came out of one of the multiverses in 'everything everywhere all at once'.

"Just as brutal and action packed as the first, reminded me of John Wick meets The Departed.  Wish the setting was as tight as the first one though, taking place in the singular tight location made it much more claustrophobic and visceral IMHO. the kitchen fight was ALMOST as great of a final all out brawl as the first films final fight.

"From the outside looking in, I was pretty nervous to watch The Raid 2. I felt like the first didn't need a sequel, much less one clocking in at almost three hours. Surely this action movie would have awful pacing! Nope. This movie is THE perfect action movie. All the fights in this movie were incredible, and the story I was worried about was interesting. I'm a sucker for undercover cop stories, and this is one of the best in…",8,"english"
"circuit breaker movie #33  the budget is bigger, the story is longer (at 2 and a half hours), the fight scenes are just as well choreographed but The Raid 2 lacks the compactness of the Raid.  It is tough to capture lightning in a bottle twice and Gareth Evans almost does it here but for a weaker storyline with characters you don't really care too much about.  save for the final fight scene between Rama/Yuda and ""The Assassin"", which literally…",6,"english"

"It's clear that the directive for this sequel was bigger and better. While this leads to a flashier look overall and a sprawling cast of characters, part of me missed the simplicity and sharp pacing of the preceding film, especially during lulls between the action. But there are some truly thrilling fight sequences here featuring almost balletic choreography, and the finale is worth the buildup.",8,"english"

My only complaint is that there’s a returning character in this movie who clearly died in the first movie. Highly recommend.",9,"english"

The story and characters were more fleshed out this time around but it doesn't get in the way of the essence of this film-that this is an action film made for…",7,"english"

Even though most of the voices seemed to fit there were some that seemed like the voice overs were yelling all the time my dad even thought I was watching an old Godzilla movie at one point!

Y'all motherfuckers on this site putting this in the ""all-timer"" action pantheon need to get yourself some Lau Kar-Leung stat (I've only seen two of his films, but both had better stories, as impressive or more impressive choreography, and violence for a point other than pure sadism). Or some…",5,"english"
"I can't say I remember much about the first The Raid film, but I do remember being impressed by the fight choreography and the largely self-contained, focused plot. It feels like a chamber play in comparison to its ambitious-but-bloated sequel.  Extraordinary action sequences aren't enough to sustain this film for its egregious 2.5 hour running time, or to make up for its confusing, convoluted plot. If you know who's on what side in which battle, you're doing better than I…",5,"english"
"The Raid was one of the best action films in a long time. Set within the claustrophobic confines of an apartment block, the film succeeded because of its purity. It was a movie that wore its intentions on its sleeve and boasted no pretensions; it was driven entirely by the inventive set pieces and eye-popping choreography and pretended to be nothing different. There was enough plot to serve the action, sure, but its centrepiece wasn't the story; it was the…",4,"english"

"The best action movie I have ever seen. Go see it, NOW.",10,"english"
"It’s amazing everything this movie is capable of from an action perspective. It contains some of the most visceral and impressive action I’ve ever seen, and a really compelling story to follow through.  There’s not a moment in the movie that doesn’t showcase some kind of talent with its filmmaking. Whether it’s the beautiful set design, mind blowing action sequences, edge of your seat story, or much more.  While I’m partial to the first for it’s stripped down and simple premise in comparison, there’s no denying this sequel the same adoration for what it accomplishes.",9,"english"
"There’s an argument to be made that this is a perfect action movie, and it’s an argument I would have no problem with.  I love that this took what made The Raid really cool and expanded it. The Raid was relatively small, in that it was essentially one location with a pretty linear, simple plot. Team comes in to kill a bad guy, gets stuck, tries to fight their way out. Simple, and it worked well as a vehicle to…",9,"english"

"The last ~45 minutes of this movie may be the greatest set of action sequences ever put to film. Unfortunately, the near 2 hours that lead up to this point don't hold the same level of energy. The drama that the film tries to build with its crime family storyline didn't do it for me.",6,"english"
"The premise of the first movie is so perfect that it was almost an impossible task for this to surpass it, but it damn well gets close. More of a focus on drama and characters wasn't exactly what I was hoping for but its still fairly compelling and only makes the moments it goes all out with the violence even more fun. But I think I still prefer the almost unrelenting pace of the original. I don't think we'll ever…",10,"english"
"More brutal than the first one but when one of the main characters’ is credited as Hammer Girl you sort of expect it. Gareth Evans clearly had more money to spend here and he used it. A few times I wondered how the camera was even getting those shots. And they must have had a bunch of stunt people in the hospital. Just crazy good fight choreography.",8,"english"
"Why Gareth Evans never made a third Raid film, I will never understand.   This might have the greatest car chase scene of all time. The story continues along perfectly, and expands the universe in a very fun way. Yayan Ruhian was a little underutilized unfortunately, especially considering he’s him, but that’s a very small issue compared to everything that was done right here. This and the first are some of the greatest action films I’ve ever seen.   Thank you Duilio…",8,"english"
"i agree with the common sense about the raid 2: it's too focused on story. the sequel could've easily been condensend into a 120 minutes movie. the plot is not only too contrived and streched out, but also cliche: there's a sea of movies that did the undercovered cop + the ""gangster family whose boss has an explosive son"" better. even so, it's a competent story for an action movie.  the three main minions have a strong anime vibe to…",8,"english"
"Such a great build off of the first movie. The fights never disappointed and never became dull. What an ending it had as well.",8,"english"
"A bit long but I prefer this over the first one. They added a bit more story to the world of the Raid and it’s protagonist Rama. Watched it again as I forgot how crazy this action series was after John Wick. We should be asking more about who Rama really was before he got into law enforcement. He is such a beast! Too bad they did not follow through with the third one. Great ending to the series.",9,"english"

Shifting loyalties, betrayals, and corruption is abundant. The story is complex and filled with tension.   The action and fighting sequences are next level. They are Brutal and Kinetic. The camerawork is also exceptional and it really brings the fights to life.   The cinematography was surprisingly great. It wasn’t a strength of the last film, but in this one it elevated the…",10,"english"
"The first film is a good movie with amazing action sequences. This one is a great movie with a wonderfully fleshed out story and characters but still with that spectacular action.  “One of the best action movies ever made” absolutely lives up to its hype. I preferred this to its predecessor just because of the world building it does. Makes it feel more epic. It’s a little long but it needs a lot of that time to flesh everything out so it warrants that run time. The action is just mesmerising and Iko is absolutely brilliant.

"Another masterpiece. Whilst I felt like the story dragged on a bit in the first act, it picked up the pace in the second and kept it to the end of the movie. Although the story may be lacking in some aspects the cinematography, action and choreography is back in full force, and in my opinion surpasses the original.

The choreography is nothing short of incredible. While Jardani Jovanovic certainly has more range in regards…",8,"english"
